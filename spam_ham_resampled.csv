Centric Enterprise Apps With Super Sized ATA Drives Maxtor Continues its Leadership in the Market it Pioneered with a New Category of High Density ATA Drives MILPITAS Calif September 9 2002 Maxtor Corporation NYSE MXO a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and data storage solutions today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM its newest generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging enterprise storage applications including near line media storage and network storage The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording and unique manufacturing and quality for 24 7 operations with mean time to failure MTTF rates exceeding one million hours The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into near line archive applications By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive architectures companies can instantly recover time critical data including executive e mail transaction data and accounting data that may need to be recovered on demand These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the storage of video media and audio conference call files Even compressed these files take up tremendous amounts of high cost server space Priced starting around 299 95 to 399 95 MSRP Maxtor s MaXLine family offers high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between traditional ATA and SCSI drives For system OEMs and white box builders MaXLine offers high density easy to integrate storage for use in entry level and mid size server environments The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e mails financial documents and transaction records said Mike Dooley senior director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor Users may not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis but when they do need access it must be instant Recent advances in ATA technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these enterprise applications The MaXLine family includes the 5400 RPM MaXLine II designed for capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200 RPM MaXLine Plus II designed for capacities up to 250 GB At these capacities MaXLine offers higher storage density than many tape and optical solutions These drives have also been tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs which exceed MTTF of over one million hours These drives will also carry a three year warranty The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM UltraATA 133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next generation serial ATA interface for higher performance At 150 MB per second maximum data transfer rate serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive environments and enterprise applications With a point to point connection architecture and rich command set for managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface serial ATA advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface The interface s reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with increased design flexibility and hot plug capability Maxtor s MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that has previously been too expensive to keep on disk said Dave Reinsel analyst at IDC The ATA drives offer a great value low cost per GB and when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling cost effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives which have been the traditional solutions used for near line applications Availability Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II are now available with volume units available in the fourth quarter Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II with serial ATA will be

 I wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time I actually lived on a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota Sioux country as well And my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than I have my experience being a direct result of living with my parents I do get a lot of my information first hand or in some cases second hand from my father The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income While it is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe not something that was impressed upon them The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals typically an Indian Corporation of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe In most tribes a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation usually to the tune of 10 30k per person depending on the tribe The dividend money comes from a number of places with the primary sources being the Federal Gov t and various businesses assets owned by the Indian corporation You have to understand a couple things First a great many Indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises Everyone gets a check for their share no matter what One of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment often 70 90 for tribal members who are more than happy take their dividend and not work The dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole income for government accounting purposes Unfortunately to support this type of economics when no one works they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works One of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk not Indians Second even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually By benefits and perks we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are ineptly run and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non Indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions An example of this is the Haida Corporation which while having less 1 000 tribal shareholders has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the 200 300 million range and growing Yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled about 20k in this particular case and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use They don t eat their seed corn and have actually managed to grow their stash In contrast a couple islands over there is another tribe of 2 000 people that has a net loss of about 50 million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets This particular tribe has a modest income in theory but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and many borrow money against future income Incidentally in this particular case the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets Somewhat annoying the Federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible typically selling the assets to American or foreign companies And the cycle continues So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems In a nutshell a thoroughly pathological culture and society Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant Incest rape and gross promiscuity is rampant Inbreeding heavy drug abuse during pregnancy and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded Many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above On one reservation my parents lived the HIV infection rate was 70 Many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious they do have their own judges courts police etc In short many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I have ever seen anywhere Because of their legal status there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior There are many things that I could tell you that I ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself There are always good people in these tribes but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times and this IS a mobocracy typically BTW if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations It will give you an interesting perspective on things There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous Indians The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely The second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part even if they maintain their tribal identity In both of these cases the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above The Indians are often quite wealthy technically and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita And the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole It is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income The poverty is social and cultural in nature not economic This was my original point On a tangent One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution That they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything But what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run It is like a Family Corporation writ large It seems that in a future where familial ties will be increasingly voluntary the general concept may have some merit in general Western society serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics but with an arbitrary set of self selecting individuals Damn that was long and its late and it could have been a lot longer James Rogers jamesr best com On 9 22 02 3 53 PM John Hall

Hi I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare You can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances That base image is never altered by a vm instance Instead each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log Future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine This is described here thanks to Duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list http www vmware com support reference common disk_sharing html Could this basic concept be used to easily make self fixing client server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks even before those attacks have been discovered Here is what I imagine The physical architectures of most production client server systems are layered For example your basic web application might have a web server running Apache connected to an application server running some J2EE or Net business logic connected to a database server for persistence The only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition It is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next Other paritions may need to be writable for say swap space but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot When someone cracks this system they will probably change an image that shouldn t be changed E g they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server But what if the web server ran off a base image writing changes to a delta or redo partition And then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted The downtime involved for each machine would be minimal because it is only deleting data rather than restoring from backup In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible This base redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware RAID allowing for greater performance reliability and hack resistance This concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course Does anyone do this already Or is this a new concept Or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don t yet know I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems It would allow for the hardware separation of volatile and non volatile disk images It would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations only it would be more efficient and involve less or no downtime Thanks for any opinions Ben ,275,528,hamnspam\ham

On Mon 2002 10 07 at 12 48 Owen Byrne wrote I suppose Canada which is supposed to be a loose confederation of 2 founding nations French and English can be cited as a success The jury is still out but so far only a few brief rebellions and referendums and such still together after 130 years Alberta and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces is definitely not happy with the current arrangement Some of this has to do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured When I was last up in Alberta a month ago the newspapers were reporting something like 70 of Albertans favor separating from Canada and over several distinct issues The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces their interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in Ottawa While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian they only have token representation in the federal government While I m not clear on exactly how the government works up there representation is not entirely based on population and it works out that some eastern provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire province of Alberta The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so much as throwing Alberta a bone and are able to do so because even the sparsely populated eastern provinces can out vote Alberta despite having fewer people Or something like that The Canadian government is less restricted than the US government so they can do strange things like having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities It is essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the inter mountain West of the US Unlike the US case though the rest of Canada would really be hurting if they weren t receiving all those tax dollars from Alberta OTOH Alberta would probably thrive I have friends in Alberta and visit occasionally but I m not totally clear on everything that goes on in that country due to my partial unfamiliarity with how the government works up there so I m a little fuzzy on some of the details What I do know is that on average the Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and the sentiment has been getting worse over the years Cheers James Rogers jamesr best com ,238,452,hamnspam\ham

This article from NYTimes com has been sent to you by khare alumni caltech edu Sure does explain FoRK not yet abandoned Rohit khare alumni caltech edu Some Friends Indeed Do More Harm Than Good September 10 2002 By MARY DUENWALD Friends are supposed to be good for you In recent years scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless They are even less susceptible to the common cold studies show But not all friends have such a salutary effect Some lie insult and betray Some are overly needy Some give too much advice Psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends Friendship is often very painful said Dr Harriet Lerner a psychologist and the author of The Dance of Connection In a close enduring friendship jealousy envy anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads One has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and I m disbanding it Another book When Friendship Hurts by Dr Jan Yager a sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside There s this myth that friendships should last a lifetime Dr Yager said But sometimes it s better that they end That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all Marriage and family relationships between siblings or parents and children have been seen as more important Of course troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are And children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad As a popular author of relationship advice books Dr Lerner said Never once have I had anyone write and say my best friend hits me Dr Beverley Fehr a professor of psychology at the University of Winnipeg noted that sociological changes like a 50 percent divorce rate have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health Now that a marital relationship can t be counted on for stability the way it was in the past and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy said Dr Fehr the author of Friendship Processes Until the past couple of years the research on friendship focused on its health benefits Now we re starting to look at it as a more full relationship said Dr Suzanna Rose a professor of psychology at Florida International University in Miami Like marriage friendship also has negative characteristics The research is in its infancy Psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship Dr Fehr said So far they have only through surveys and interviews figured out that it is a significant problem The early research Dr Fehr added is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought How can a friend be bad Most obviously Dr Rose said by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill advised pursuit When you think of people who were friends at Enron she added you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship When friends split up said Dr Keith E Davis a professor of psychology at the University of South Carolina it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential Another form of betrayal Dr Yager said is when a friend suddenly turns cold without ever explaining why It s more than just pulling away she said The silent treatment is actually malicious At least as devastating is an affair with the friend s romantic partner as recently happened to one of Dr Lerner s patients I would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out Dr Lerner said A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person Dr Yager said One of the 180 people who responded to Dr Yager s most recent survey on friendship described how when she was 11 her best friend called her a derogatory name The woman now 32 was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since Dr Yager said Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse but it is more insidious Dr Yager said Some people constantly set up their friends she explained They ll have a party not invite the friend but make sure he or she finds out Risk takers betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends Dr Yager said but they are not the only ones She identifies 21 different varieties Occupying the second tier of badness are the liar the person who is overly dependent the friend who never listens the person who meddles too much in a friend s life the competitor and the loner who prefers not to spend time with friends Most common is the promise breaker This includes everyone from the person who says let s have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them but then isn t Dr Yager said Some friendships go bad as some romantic relationships do when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one With couples it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to discover there s something important they don t like about the other person said Dr Rose of Florida International One might find for example that in subtle ways the other person is a racist In friendships which are less intense it may take even more time for one person to meet the other s dislike criteria Whether a friendship is worth saving Dr Lerner said depends on how large the injury is Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go she added It s also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person s limitations Acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses Dr Lerner said because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress the healthy response is to pull away Dr Yager said to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life and start being too busy to get together ever It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship but only one to end it Dr Yager said Friendship because it is voluntary and unregulated is far easier to dissolve than marriage But it is also comparatively fragile experts say Ideally the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones Dr Lerner said It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you re healthy and your life and work are going well she said Because when a crisis hits when someone you love dies or you lose your job and your health insurance when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability you will discover how crucial and life preserving good friendship is http www nytimes com 2002

Hardware acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down a transaction by as much as 1 000 fold Per this article XML formatting only increases doc size by about 20 fold I m not sure there are enough powers of ten in there to justify hardware acceleration Expect the next major release from DataPower to be the revolutionary new email chip allows you to offload the sending and receiving of email messages onto dedicated hardware while you get on w more important things like listening to MP3s Best Paul Sholtz Original Message From Rohit Khare To fork example com Sent 8 27 02 3 00 PM Subject DataPower announces XML in silicon No analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet But here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on Best Rohit DataPower delivers XML acceleration device By Scott Tyler Shafer August 27 2002 5 46 am PT DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software DataPower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials The new device dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the Cambridge Mass based startup The DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis parsing and processing of the XML data According to Steve Kelly CEO of DataPower the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML the anticipated future proliferation of Web services and as a means to share data between two businesses Our vision is to build out an XML aware infrastructure Kelly said The XA35 is the first of a family Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up to 20 times This he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative In addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML Today s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only Kelly said A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall Firewalls are blind to XML today Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as Web services proliferate Kelly said According to DataPower most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security After trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code said Kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing claims that he believes will be mostly false Other content aware switches such as SSL secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first 64 bytes of a packet while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection looking at 1 400 bytes and thus enabling greater processing of XML data Kelly explained The 1U high network device has been tested against a large collection of XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML Kelly said In addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market Startup Sarvega based in Burr Ridge Ill introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in May and earlier this month Tarari an Intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration The DataPower device is now available priced starting at 54 995 The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks Long before industry interest in XML grew Kuznetsov assembled a team of world class M I T engineers and designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT This software based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software based accelerators Kuznetsov s team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose built hardware In 2001 DataPower s effort produced XML Generation Three XG3 the industry s fastest technology for XML processing bar none Today XG3 technology powers the industry s first wire speed XML network devices enabling secure high speed applications and XML Web Services While other companies are just now marketing first versions of products DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry leading customers and partners DataPower s M I T heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in

marketing and sales of the company s breakthrough technology for XML Aware networking Founded in 1999 DataPower invented the world s first intelligent XML networking devices capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions at the wire speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services and other XML centric initiatives DataPower s solutions are based on its patent pending XML Generation Three XG3 technology Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter and intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type DataPower s XML acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of XML that is required to support next generation enterprise applications said Eugene Kuznetsov CTO and founder of DataPower Technology DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that s critical to Web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance A single DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment In addition the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security protection against XML based denial of service attacks connection of e business protocols for incompatible XML data streams load balancing between back end servers and real time statistics reports In the post bubble economy technology investment decisions require laser focused scrutiny DataPower s patent pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises said Michael Tyrrell of Venrock Associates By turbo charging their networks with DataPower s unique XML Aware networking technology companies will be free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and security said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital DataPower is on their third generation of technology Their patent pending XML Generation Three XG3 technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date XML is not a nice to have it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency Since 1999 DataPower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web services said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners DataPower s XML acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely on XML for mission critical applications About Venrock Associates Venrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the

URL http www joelonsoftware com news 20020912 html Date Not supplied We re trying to decide if FogBUGZ 1 3 0 should support custom fields Historically I am opposed to custom fields in principle because they get abused People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard End result people don t enter bugs which is much much worse than not capturing all that information You can always page fault to get the information if the original report forgot it Rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine this is an actual customer request information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs why not just have the programmer assignee look at the bug first and if they think it might be dll version related only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the DLL info Similarly it s always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred This sounds logical but trust me adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant But then how do you search for say all bugs which only happen on Windows 98SE Aha You can t Ever Even with the custom field Because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system so this search doesn t make sense in the first place The info wasn t captured Do a full text search for 98SE and you ll find some of them Life is imperfect Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on the computer in question and while you re at it a photograph of the tester s workspace But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_ which all else being equal takes priority over making it easy to find them I have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so high ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system because they didn t know what all those fields were The _real_ bug tracking happened in email post its and hallway conversations Great A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is does FogBUGZ support custom fields Rather than giving our usual answer no on purpose over the last few weeks I ve been saying can you please tell me what fields you would need We re trying to decide whether to implement that feature in 3 0 and we want to know why people need it The interesting thing is almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ _ and the other ones in my educated opinion shouldn t be fields And in fact our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields One of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company and I myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design but I didn t and they never needed it even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product Gosh even Filemaker has custom fields Righto It s true And who am I to tell my customers they are wrong One person who I was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a built in field for This would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved But it s still rude of me to tell customers that we don t have that feature _for their own good_ even though it usually is and we re losing some sales because of it Sigh I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people don t use it At least we won t lose any sales 1 http www fogcreek com FogBUGZ ,350,803,hamnspam\ham

author documents reschedule meetings relaunch meetings Webex likes it as people are signed on all the time Greg September 19 2002 Tadpole s Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web Meetings Leader WebEx Communications To Provide Best of Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During and Between Online Meetings Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for users of the Web s secure P2P collaboration network Tadpole Technology plc the mobile computing and network infrastructure group today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary Endeavors Technology Inc has teamed with Web meetings leader WebEx Communications Inc to help professionals make better use of corporate time and resources and gain competitive advantage By integrating the advanced communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors secure P2P collaboration network Endeavors has created a new method of world class teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings the rationale for this world class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience between online meetings The issue by those preferring not to travel is how to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between meetings rather than depending on intermittent insecure email and multiple copies of constantly changing documents Inter meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium independent of time In asynchronous mode a team member can access read and edit information relevant to the meeting group at his her convenience rather than having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others A secured environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also essential Endeavors Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for sharing information directly from people s desktops WebEx meetings can be recorded and reviewed at any time documents shared in the meeting can be actioned in real time or at a later date calendars and project schedules can be updated at any time and new individuals added to the workgroup at will all in a secure environment with people working across the globe inside or outside company firewalls Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web meeting participants Not only can they share and access information at will but they can also know which other participants are online or present This enables them to chat and message each other search across other people s Magi environment and work jointly on relevant documents highly productively With Magi collaboration in tandem with WebEx conferencing the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs phone bills and most importantly timely completion of projects and tasks In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings best of breed services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries says Bernard Hulme Tadpole s group chief executive The powerful combination of Endeavors Magi and WebEx s communications technologies will assist global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales marketing training support and product design says David Farrington vice president of corporate development at WebEx Communications By integrating the communications capabilities of the WebEx platform

If you need to store a database password then clearly the first step is to store the text outside the web tree You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere so that at least an attacker has to get two different things Also don t get full privileges create a user account that is GRANTed very limited access However you can often do better than this if security is critical Create a separate program which has these database keys as noted above and make the web program contact IT Create a very limited protocol that ONLY lets you do the operations you need you can add specific operations later There s a performance hit which you re trading for improved data isolation Giorgio Zoppi wrote On Fri Aug 23 2002 David Wheeler wrote The standard way to store passwords is not to store passwords Instead store a salted hash of the password in a database When you get a purported password you re salt it compute the hash and determine if they are the same This is how Unix has done it for years You want bigger hashes and salts than the old Unix systems and you still want to prevent reading from those files to foil password crackers More info is in my book at http www dwheeler com secure programs Well but this cannot be applied to database password which most web apps use The only solution I figure is store in clear outside web tree any other ideas feasible Ciao Giorgio Never is Forever deneb penguin it Homepage http www cli di unipi it zoppi index html David A Wheeler dwheeler ida org ,176,278,hamnspam\ham

Owen Byrne writes quoting http www quinion com words qa qa shi2 htm SHIVER MY TIMBERS From Tad Spencer Please could you tell me where the phrase shiver my timbers originated This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any actual sailors usage It s an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver or shake so implying a calamity has occurred It is first recorded as being used by Captain Frederick Marryat in Jacob Faithful in 1835 I won t thrash you Tom Shiver my timbers if I do It seems implausible to me that shiver here means to shake I don t recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense and web1913 lists that sense as v i or intransitive The transitive sense of shiver which we no longer use but which people used widely in the 1800s web1913 doesn t even list it as archaic or obsolete means to shatter into splinters normally with a blow Shivering a boat s timbers of course leaves you with no boat Shivering some of them which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough leaves you with a sinking boat So Shiver my timbers if I do can be reasonably interpreted as a more vivid way of saying May I die suddenly if I do The interpretation suggested by Quinion May my boat be damaged neither makes as much sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar I ve sent a copy of this to Quinion ,173,276,hamnspam\ham
 Ben Mord said Ah In that case you can use something considerably less powerful than VMWare All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD ROM But RAM is expensive and the directory structures of many systems e g Windows are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical Even if you are fortunate enough to be using Linux or another FHS compliant nix you still can t fit a lot on a CD Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of static multimedia content on the web server This particular problem can be alleviated somewhat by using DVDs but this is a temporary solution at best which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard drives become cheaper So just write protect the hard disk for partitions that are static I seem to recall an article on this early 80 s Byte magazine perhaps for BBS systems or for testing unknown perhaps trojan horse software George George Dinwiddie gdinwiddie alberg30 org The gods do not deduct from man s allotted span those hours spent in sailing http www Alberg30 org ,156,219,hamnspam\ham

 BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE Hash SHA1 Say amen somebody What the WSJ said appended below The WTC as constructed was a confiscatory government boondoggle expropriated from the original pre construction property owners at the behest of a third generation trust fund aristocrat for the good of the city and owned by an authority looking for something else to do after it and its coach hounds in organized labor and organized crime had killed what was the largest port in the world s richest nation Now of course it s about to get worse The sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics first those in religion and now those in government As a result a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space devoted at least ostensibly to commerce will be granted away in a potlatch that only government and special interest communities or stakeholders or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho rabble call themselves this week can organize to such perfection All this in probably the only city in the country that was founded by a business explicitly for the purpose of commerce Not religious fanaticism Not colonial expansion in a monarch s name Commerce If they really wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government disarmed passengers the so called authority should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the market the cure to all luddism foreign and domestic government and superstitious decide If the new private owner wants to sell or give away a space for a memorial fine They could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured Probably great for marketing the property at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event And of course if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet splendid Whatever the market will bear In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans national geodesic internetworks of strong financial cryptography and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries economics and freedom can and will prevail over both superstition and statism It s probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower Manhattan mega real estate to prevail this early in the game but it s going to happen sooner or later And whenever it does that will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the World Trade Center Cheers RAH http online wsj com article_print 0 SB1031705210159756235 00 html The Wall Street Journal September 11 2002 REVIEW OUTLOOK A Living Memorial As we write these words we can look down from our offices into the six story crater where the Twin Towers once stood Like everyone else we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago But we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions especially today anger grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there But underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted The best expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working meeting shopping eating that is engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there Osama bin Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has been about So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown Manhattan which lost 100 000 jobs when the Trade Center fell Instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action New York s political leadership and its financial and media elites are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better more prosperous city This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site In consultation with New York Governor George Pataki who is thinking primarily about his own November re election the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial The Manhattan Institute s Steve Malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial This is in essence what the Pentagon has so successfully done rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial a design for which has yet to be decided A big part of the problem in New York is that the city s anti development activists know an opening when they see one They want the World Trade Center site and even some surrounding areas transformed into an enormous park These political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation and the World Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment Worse they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti development agenda in the name of honoring the dead One family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site We are not experts in designing war memorials but we re confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world s financial center isn t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago The great cities of Europe and Japan devastated in World War II have all rebuilt and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam the Dutch port city reduced to rubble by German bombing where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be In this country the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University you ll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary War the War of 1812 the Civil War the Spanish American War World War I World War II Korea and Southeast Asia No one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names In New York now it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city s future Rudolph Giuliani now that he s out office wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial Governor Pataki has called for no structures on the footprints which being in the center of the site would severely curtail options Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past Maybe those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months The best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce BEGIN PGP

First misattribution I did not write the blurb below I made one statement about VP Cheney only to wit that he has a short memory I couldn t agree with you more on this in short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not theft the rich don t get rich off the backs of the poor and redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit happy or otherwise however I resent being lumped in a zero sum zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich and successful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning to understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad hominem re Cheney align themselves weird sylogisms like if rich then deservedly or if rich then smarter Given that I am also beginning to understand why

them seem to have Ivy League educations or are Ivy League dropouts suggesting to me that they weren t exactly poor to start with Actually if I remember correctly from discussion of the list s composition in Forbes about five or six years ago the best way to get on the Forbes 400 is to have no college at all Can you say Bootstraps boys and girls I knew you could Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school like say mine is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government run high school you ll probably get more of those on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on If we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government collapsing transfer payment depression an economic version of this summer s government forest conflagration caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear cutting enough forests did out west this summer that should motivate more than a few erst slackers out there including me to learn to actually feed themselves The next category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a terminal professional degree like an MBA PhD MD etc from the best school possible Why Because as of about 1950 the best way to get into Harvard for instance is to be smart not rich Don t take my word for it ask their admissions office Look at the admissions stats over the years for proof Meritocracy American Style was invented at the Ivy League after World War II Even Stanford got the hint and of course Chicago taught them all how right Practically nobody who goes to a top 20 American institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days Unless of course their parents who couldn t afford to go there themselves got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so And their kids still had to get the grades and biased by intelligence test scores to get in The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees until they actually own something and hire people or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis persist in the practically insane belief like life after death that economics is some kind of zero sum game that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money and if someone is smart works hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow BTW none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that I m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders You were apparently too dumb to grab the right end I went to Missouri and I don t have a degree in anything actually useful much less a terminal one which means I m broker than anyone on this list it s just that you of all people lots with educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better The facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look There are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and economics is not a zero sum game The cost of anything including ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case intelligence and effort I will however admit to being educated waay past my level of competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you apparently BTW if we ever actually had free markets in this country including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have more money and there would be more self made people on that list In addition most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it not even relatively speaking Finally practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not That efficiency is called progress for those of you in The People s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge It means more and better stuff cheaper over time a terrible petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or you d know about it by now In economic terms it s also called an increase in general welfare and no Virginia I m not talking about extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as Santa Claus come election time In short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not theft the rich don t get rich off the

Why am I so passionate about decentralization Because I believe some of today s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization Generically a centralized political or economic system permits only one answer to a question while decentralization permits many separate agents to hold different opinions of the same matter In the specific context of software centralized variables can only contain one valid value at a time That limits us to only representing information A according to the beliefs of a single agency and B that changes more slowly than it takes to propagate Nevertheless centralization is the basis for today s most popular architectural style for developing network applications client server interaction using request response communication protocols I believe these are profound limitations which we are already encountering in practice Spam for example is in the eye of the beholder yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the separate interests of senders and receivers Slamming for another unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest latency connection to a centralized auction server Sharing ad hoc wireless networks is yet a third example of decentralized resource allocation Furthermore as abstract as centralization induced failures might seem today these limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing storage and communication bandwidth continue to plummet Instead the speed of light and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized information representation and hence centralized software architecture ,160,237,hamnspam\ham

Khare khare alumni caltech edu To fork example com Sent Friday September 20 2002 5 10 PM Subject sed s United States Roman Empire g A world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day is neither just nor stable Absolutely correct Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on Earth today The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy that bears close reading It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations It does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the Muslim world This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa our new music and news channel for 15 30 year old Arabs It s 1 in practically every market it s entered nearing 90 listenership in Amman And it s even beginning to be trusted for news well past BBC and taking share from every other government broadcaster It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term Many of you may disagree but I found the document below surprisingly centrist If you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re ICC Taiwan Relations Act etc But still this is as much a Democratic platform as not Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared they might As you read replace United States with Roman Empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history I don t know how proud to be about that but it is telling Sometime I daydream that the President might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700 military installations overseas and what they do for us It would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us Heck I d love to see a real

repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world Rohit September 20 2002 Full Text Bush s National Security Strategy Following is the full text of President Bush s new national security strategy The document entitled The National Security Strategy of the United States will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of the Administration s policy INTRODUCTION THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise In the twenty first century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity People everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor These values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages Today the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence In keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty By making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better We will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government Today that task has changed dramatically Enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America Now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror And America will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization The United States and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases Together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination The United States will not allow these efforts to succeed We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery We will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies And as a matter of common sense and self defense America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act In the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action As we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace Today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war Today the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos The United States will build on these common interests to promote global security We are also increasingly united by common values Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth In time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness America will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement Finally the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world The events of September 11 2001 taught us that weak states like Afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers Yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the United States will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity The United States will deliver greater development assistance through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of AIDS and other infectious diseases In building a balance of power that favors freedom the United States is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent For freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations the World Trade Organization the Organization of American States and NATO as well as other long standing alliances Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions In all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously They are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment Freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization Throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease Today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission I Overview of America s International Strategy Our Nation s cause has always been larger than our Nation s defense We fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 The United States possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world Sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom For most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality That great struggle is over The militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few We must defeat these threats to our Nation allies and friends This is also a time of opportunity for America We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty The U S national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better Our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity And this path is not America s alone It is open to all To achieve these goals the United States will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform America s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century II Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong I disagree Different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 In pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere No nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them Fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence No people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property These demands can be met in many ways America s constitution has served us well Many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance History has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals But even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were there to guide us As a result America is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society Today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty And when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991 or in Belgrade in 2000 When we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in the Republic of Korea and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin America and Africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the United States must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty Our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources They will guide our actions and our words in international bodies We will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it III Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends Just three days removed from these events Americans do not yet have the distance of history But our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder This nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger The conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others It will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing President Bush Washington D C The National Cathedral September 14 2001 The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology The enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents In many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace Such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process But no cause justifies terror The United States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them We make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals Afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al Qaida But it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America South America Europe Africa the Middle East and across Asia Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists Once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism We will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks However this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction WMD or their precursors defending the United States the American people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism This includes using the full influence of the United States and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the Muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening America s homeland security to protect against and deter attack This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council and the Department of Defense Centered on a new Department of Homeland Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the FBI our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity For example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards Our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers Our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic While our focus is protecting America we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends Wherever possible the United States will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism Where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the United Nations as well as non governmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists In the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life Freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict In leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century IV Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts We build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small President Bush Berlin Germany May 23 2002 Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering In an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity When violence erupts and states falter the United States will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U S action direct or indirect is warranted We have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities The United States will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind The United States should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge The United States should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves Where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles The Israeli Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of America s close relationship with the state of Israel and key Arab states and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the United States There can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine living beside Israel in peace and security Like all other people Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes The United States will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict The United States the international donor community and the World Bank stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary If Palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine Permanent occupation threatens Israel s identity and democracy So the United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible Palestinian state As there is progress towards security Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28 2000 And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop As violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life The United States can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them In South Asia the United States has also emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes This administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and Pakistan These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute With Pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society The Administration sees India s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly Our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law By tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets Indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation It is the initiative by Indonesia that allows U S assistance to make a difference In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly Mexico Brazil Canada Chile and Colombia Together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope We will work with regional institutions such as the Summit of the Americas process the Organization of American States OAS and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices This conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the United States Therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country In Colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups We are working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the Colombian people In Africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty This threatens both a core value of the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror American interests and American principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity Together with our European allies we must help strengthen Africa s fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones Forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats Africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing This administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South Africa Nigeria Kenya and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with European allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and Africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub Saharan Africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference The transition to the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent V Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us Our Allies and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass Destruction The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations Our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons They want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War our security environment has undergone profound transformation Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with Russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union However the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make today s security environment more complex and dangerous In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes These states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it stands At the time of the Gulf War we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against Iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents In the past decade North Korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal Other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well These states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends Our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes Proactive counterproliferation efforts We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed We must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems Counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD armed adversaries Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction We will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials We will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs The recent G 8 agreement to commit up to 20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD use whether by terrorists or hostile states Minimizing the effects of WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends The United States must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past The inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of today s threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option We cannot let our enemies strike first In the Cold War especially following the Cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo risk averse adversary Deterrence was an effective defense But deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations In the Cold War weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them Today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors These weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states Such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness The overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to action For centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries Rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means They know such attacks would fail Instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11 2001 mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security The greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the United States will if necessary act preemptively The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather We will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions To support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the United States or our allies and friends The reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just VI Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free Trade When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough When nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively President Bush Monterrey Mexico March 22 2002 A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world Economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America s shores All governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge We will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity The lessons of history are clear market economies not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty Policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U S national security interests We want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security European efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are Japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the Japanese banking system We will continue to use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners including through the Group of Seven G 7 to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth International flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies These flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty Our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost To this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets We will work actively with other countries the International Monetary Fund IMF and the private sector to implement the G 7 Action Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing so We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy The concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics If you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them If others make something that you value you should be able to buy it This is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living To promote free trade the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy Seize the global initiative The new global trade negotiations we helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in 2005 The United States has led the way in completing the accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade Organization We will assist Russia s preparations to join the WTO Press regional initiatives The United States and other democracies in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas targeted for completion in 2005 This year the United States will advocate market access negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement We will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent Africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and leading to free trade Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements Building on the free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001 the Administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world Initially Central America Southern Africa Morocco and Australia will be our principal focal points Renew the executive congressional partnership Every administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with Congress After a gap of 8 years the Administration reestablished majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002 This Administration will work with Congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade Promotion Authority Promote the connection between trade and development Trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries The United States is implementing The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of sub Saharan Africa We will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities Beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV AIDS tuberculosis and malaria Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices Commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the European Union Canada and Mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture Laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping International industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred Help domestic industries and workers adjust There is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the American steel industry The benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices These safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American workers Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets Protect the environment and workers The United States must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity We will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into U S trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO and use the International Labor Organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade Enhance energy security We will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the Western Hemisphere Africa Central Asia and the Caspian region We will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate Our overall objective is to reduce America s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years by the year 2012 Our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic U N Framework Convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for U S cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of 4 5 billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a 700 million increase over last year s budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as China and India so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path VII Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy In World War II we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens President Bush Washington D C Inter American Development Bank March 14 2002 A world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day is neither just nor stable Including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of U S international policy Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries Worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery Results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients These are the indicators of a failed strategy Working with other nations the United States is confronting this failure We forged a new consensus at the U N Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change This Administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies Where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance The United States and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform We propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the United States While continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom Governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship The Millennium Challenge Account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development banks in raising living standards The United States is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor We have reversed the downward trend in U S contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U S contributions to the International Development Association IDA the World Bank s fund for the poorest countries and the African Development Fund The key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries We will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development Every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor When it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families We have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results For this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals Thanks to U S leadership the recent IDA replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress For the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the achievement of actual development results and part of the U S contribution is linked in this way We will strive to make sure that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans Greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens As a result of U S leadership the recent IDA agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education HIV AIDS health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs Our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks We will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results Open societies to commerce and investment Trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth Even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment An effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy Secure public health The scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like HIV AIDS malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained Resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure The United States has strongly backed the new global fund for HIV AIDS organized by U N Secretary General Kofi Annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care The United States already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor If the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more Emphasize education Literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources are devoted to education This proportion should grow The United States will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in Africa The United States can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by AIDS Continue to aid agricultural development New technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water Using sound science the United States should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people including 300 million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition VIII Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power We have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom Effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in Canada and Europe Europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter European security and the European Union EU our partner in opening world trade The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO as NATO itself recognized when it invoked its Article V self defense clause for the first time NATO s core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but NATO must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances NATO must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under NATO s own mandate as well as contributing to mission based coalitions To achieve this we must expand NATO s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the Cold War We will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests At the same time we welcome our European allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the EU and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO We cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come The attacks of September 11 energized America s Asian alliances Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an attack on Australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for Operation Enduring Freedom Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack We have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand The war against terrorism has proven that America s alliances in Asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges To enhance our Asian alliances and friendships we will look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term build on 50 years of U S Australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition Several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly Russia India and China In all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape With Russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the United States and Russia are no longer strategic adversaries The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the Euro Atlantic community and the United States Russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses They understand increasingly that Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism We are facilitating Russia s entry into the World Trade Organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations We have created the NATO Russia Council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among Russia our European allies and ourselves We will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce Russia s growing commitment to integration into the Euro Atlantic community At the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership Lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our relations Russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern Russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation Nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with India based on a conviction that U S interests require a strong relationship with India We are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well We have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean Finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia Differences remain including over the development of India s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of India s economic reforms But while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about India today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests Through a strong partnership with India we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future The United States relationship with China is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous Asia Pacific region We welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous China The democratic development of China is crucial to that future Yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the Communist legacy China s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the Asia Pacific region China is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness In time China will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing China We already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean peninsula Likewise we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns Shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of HIV AIDS challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights China has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the Communist Party To make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done Only by allowing the Chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can China reach its full potential Our important trade relationship will benefit from China s entry into the World Trade Organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers workers and companies China is our fourth largest trading partner with over 100 billion in annual two way trade The power of market principles and the WTO s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens There are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements Our commitment to the self defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one Human rights is another We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments We will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree The events of September 11 2001 fundamentally changed the context for relations between the United States and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities With our long standing allies in Europe and Asia and with leaders in Russia India and China we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge We can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action In the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress IX Transform America s National Security Institutions to Meet the Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty First Century Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity They did not touch its source America is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people President Bush Washington D C Joint Session of Congress September 20 2001 The major institutions of American national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements All of them must be transformed It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge Our military s highest priority is to defend the United States To do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against U S interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions However the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces A military structured to deter massive Cold War era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the U S commitments to allies and friends Through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of U S forces Before the war in Afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies Yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces We must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure U S access to distant theaters and protect critical U S infrastructure and assets in outer space Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting U S intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention Finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the President with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the United States our allies and our friends We know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred The United States must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the United States our allies or our friends We will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the United States Intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states Designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the Soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats Intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends We need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us Those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security Since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the United States we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement Initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to lead the development and actions of the Nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend America s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy The State Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments And in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions Officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes As humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems Effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by American readiness to play our part Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand America The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations It does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the Muslim world This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the International Criminal Court ICC whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans and which we do not accept We will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect U S nationals from the ICC We will implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U S personnel and officials We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this war At home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the American people Today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing In a globalized world events beyond America s borders have a greater impact inside them Our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe The characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism This vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks As time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons This is a new condition of life We will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it In exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners Still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require When we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives We will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values Ultimately the foundation of American strength is at home It is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions A diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy Our strength comes from what we do with that energy That is where our national security begins ,2695,13302,hamnspam\ham

The Times September 06 2002 Hitler style applicant welcomed by parties By Roger Boyes MANAGERS of Germany s political parties are having difficulty explaining their enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed largely from Mein Kampf Hitler s personal manifesto The incident illustrates how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an election campaign even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to those of the Führer Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the present Chancellor said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union headquarters in Ingolstadt Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland said the letter signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald The CSU immediately spotted a potential member Many thanks for your nice thoughts replied the local party manager who enclosed an application for membership The letter used chunks of Hitler s book which is still banned in Germany History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries The strongest the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of existence only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive the letter writer said So called humanity is melting like snow in the March sun Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf which was written while Hitler was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923 Similar letters also using the Nazi leader s words were sent to the other political parties and drew sympathetic responses I read your letter with great interest and pleasure the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in Cologne said Great that you want to join us enthused the Green Party headquarters The Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball at which Hans Dietrich Genscher the former Foreign Minister would be the star guest The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by Gerhard Schröder the Chancellor I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right wing extremism said the letter writer who was in fact the Cologne novelist Rainer Popp I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special Branch to knock on my door Instead only the postman called with packets of election material from zealous political headquarters Herr Popp said I was stunned that political parties could react in this way I reckon I would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler Yahoo Groups Sponsor 4 DVDs Free s p Join Now http us click yahoo com pt6YBB NXiEAA MVfIAA 7gSolB TM To unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe egroups com Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to http docs yahoo com info terms ,289,483,hamnspam\ham

URL http diveintomark org archives 2002 10 04 html history_of_the_tilde Date 2002 10 04T00 27 41 05 00 So I was researching the history of the tilde because D told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a tilde in it Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time Which to be honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work But never mind that I don t want to talk about corporate politics I want to talk about the tilde Every command line loving geek will tell you that stands for 8220 home directory 8221 and cd will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone else s except on Mac OS X where it will take you to their Public file sharing directory It is from this heritage that we can trace the present day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal pages since one single system wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory Or more commonly now that Apache has taken over the world in their public_html subdirectory except on Mac OS X where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http localhost username you re actually being served files from that user s Sites directory within their home directory But I don t want to talk about Mac OS X I want to talk about the tilde As with so many other things I find that Jukka Korpela 1 is the expert in this field Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass 2 a word which Google old habits die hard 3 feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene Wallingford which like Jukka s home page can not be referenced without a tilde In fact Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in URLs 4 a treatise which I feel obliged to point out contains a tilde in its URL Clearly the tilde is underappreciated Digging further we find this post of Jukka s from 1998 5 in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd character called the overline Presumably to balance out the underline if indeed those sorts of things require balance There is balance in the universe to be sure but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard No matter The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish typing types could type the ntilde now referenced in HTML as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along the line it morphed into a general purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses Digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 6 then an alternate for and its life as an overline replacement came even later Jukka confirms this 7 and adds a timeline 1963 for 1964 for 1966 for overline Then June 30 1966 the watershed moment in an X3 committee meeting when it was proposed 8220 as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease SHARE 8221 I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means or what this committee meeting was about The next reference isn t until 1991 when the tilde was officially added to ISO 646 8 And now down the rabbit hole we go Scouring Usenet which the kids of yesterday called 8220 Deja News 8221 and kids today call 8220 Google Groups 8221 we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire yes _that_ William Safire article On Language 9 in which we learn that is officially pronounced 8220 squiggle 8221 This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary 10 to this very day I m not sure this is useful but I just thought it was cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ASCII characters As early as August 1990 tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem 11 In July 1989 Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde 12 In February 1988 an editor s note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde 13 As early as January 1987 less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF 14 As early as July 1986 troff supported the tilde 15 In November 1985 a mod sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements history tilde job control 16 As early as January 1984 tilde was included on the DEC keyboard 17 and listed in the APL 11 character set 18 In April 1983 tilde was causing bugs in vi 19 actually due to underlying bugs in csh In December 1982 is officially pronounced 8220 tilde 8221 20 prompting this typographical pun 21 And that s the earliest reference I can find So where does that leave us Unsatisfied no doubt There is history here but there are gaps What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966 How did the tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s When did it become a synonym for 8220 home directory 8221 When did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites I don t know and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research a failing for which I apologize profusely Goodnight goodnight May you dream of tildes stars and whorls 1 http www cs tut fi jkorpela 2 http www cs uni edu

 Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty I m not a socio political history buff does anybody have some clear examples Original Message From Rohit Khare khare alumni caltech edu To fork example com Sent Friday September 20 2002 5 10 PM Subject sed s United States Roman Empire g A world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day is neither just nor stable Absolutely correct Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on Earth today The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy that bears close reading It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations It does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the Muslim world This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa our new music and news channel for 15 30 year old Arabs It s 1 in practically every market it s entered nearing 90 listenership in Amman And it s even beginning to be trusted for news well past BBC and taking share from every other government broadcaster It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term Many of you may disagree but I found the document below surprisingly centrist If you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re ICC Taiwan Relations Act etc But still this is as much a Democratic platform as not Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared they might As you read replace United States with Roman Empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history I don t know how proud to be about that but it is telling Sometime I daydream that the President might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700 military installations overseas and what they do for us It would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us Heck I d love to see a real

influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy Of course this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the Bush Doctrine for pre emptive strikes I d sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world Rohit September 20 2002 Full Text Bush s National Security Strategy Following is the full text of President Bush s new national security strategy The document entitled The National Security Strategy of the United States will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of the Administration s policy INTRODUCTION THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise In the twenty first century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity People everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor These values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages Today the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence In keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty By making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better We will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government Today that task has changed dramatically Enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America Now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror And America will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization The United States and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases Together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination The United States will not allow these efforts to succeed We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery We will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies And as a matter of common sense and self defense America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act In the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action As we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace Today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war Today the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos The United States will build on these common interests to promote global security We are also increasingly united by common values Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth In time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness America will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement Finally the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world The events of September 11 2001 taught us that weak states like Afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers Yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the United States will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity The United States will deliver greater development assistance through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of AIDS and other infectious diseases In building a balance of power that favors freedom the United States is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent For freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations the World Trade Organization the Organization of American States and NATO as well as other long standing alliances Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions In all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously They are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment Freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization Throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease Today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission I Overview of America s International Strategy Our Nation s cause has always been larger than our Nation s defense We fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 The United States possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world Sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom For most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality That great struggle is over The militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few We must defeat these threats to our Nation allies and friends This is also a time of opportunity for America We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty The U S national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better Our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity And this path is not America s alone It is open to all To achieve these goals the United States will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform America s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century II Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong I disagree Different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 In pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere No nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them Fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence No people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property These demands can be met in many ways America s constitution has served us well Many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance History has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals But even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were there to guide us As a result America is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society Today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty And when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991 or in Belgrade in 2000 When we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in the Republic of Korea and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin America and Africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the United States must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty Our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources They will guide our actions and our words in international bodies We will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it III Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends Just three days removed from these events Americans do not yet have the distance of history But our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder This nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger The conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others It will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing President Bush Washington D C The National Cathedral September 14 2001 The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology The enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents In many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace Such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process But no cause justifies terror The United States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them We make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals Afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al Qaida But it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America South America Europe Africa the Middle East and across Asia Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists Once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism We will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks However this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction WMD or their precursors defending the United States the American people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism This includes using the full influence of the United States and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the Muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening America s homeland security to protect against and deter attack This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council and the Department of Defense Centered on a new Department of Homeland Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the FBI our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity For example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards Our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers Our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic While our focus is protecting America we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends Wherever possible the United States will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism Where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the United Nations as well as non governmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists In the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life Freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict In leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century IV Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts We build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small President Bush Berlin Germany May 23 2002 Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering In an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity When violence erupts and states falter the United States will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U S action direct or indirect is warranted We have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities The United States will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind The United States should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge The United States should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves Where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles The Israeli Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of America s close relationship with the state of Israel and key Arab states and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the United States There can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine living beside Israel in peace and security Like all other people Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes The United States will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict The United States the international donor community and the World Bank stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary If Palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine Permanent occupation threatens Israel s identity and democracy So the United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible Palestinian state As there is progress towards security Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28 2000 And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop As violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life The United States can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them In South Asia the United States has also emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes This administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and Pakistan These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute With Pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society The Administration sees India s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly Our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law By tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets Indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation It is the initiative by Indonesia that allows U S assistance to make a difference In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly Mexico Brazil Canada Chile and Colombia Together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope We will work with regional institutions such as the Summit of the Americas process the Organization of American States OAS and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices This conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the United States Therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country In Colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups We are working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the Colombian people In Africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty This threatens both a core value of the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror American interests and American principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity Together with our European allies we must help strengthen Africa s fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones Forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats Africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing This administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South Africa Nigeria Kenya and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with European allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and Africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub Saharan Africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference The transition to the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent V Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us Our Allies and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass Destruction The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations Our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons They want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War our security environment has undergone profound transformation Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with Russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union However the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make today s security environment more complex and dangerous In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes These states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it stands At the time of the Gulf War we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against Iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents In the past decade North Korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal Other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well These states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends Our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes Proactive counterproliferation efforts We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed We must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems Counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD armed adversaries Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction We will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials We will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs The recent G 8 agreement to commit up to 20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD use whether by terrorists or hostile states Minimizing the effects of WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends The United States must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past The inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of today s threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option We cannot let our enemies strike first In the Cold War especially following the Cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo risk averse adversary Deterrence was an effective defense But deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations In the Cold War weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them Today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors These weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states Such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness The overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to action For centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries Rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means They know such attacks would fail Instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11 2001 mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security The greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the United States will if necessary act preemptively The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather We will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions To support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the United States or our allies and friends The reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just VI Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free Trade When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough When nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively President Bush Monterrey Mexico March 22 2002 A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world Economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America s shores All governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge We will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity The lessons of history are clear market economies not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty Policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U S national security interests We want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security European efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are Japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the Japanese banking system We will continue to use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners including through the Group of Seven G 7 to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth International flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies These flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty Our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost To this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets We will work actively with other countries the International Monetary Fund IMF and the private sector to implement the G 7 Action Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing so We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy The concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics If you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them If others make something that you value you should be able to buy it This is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living To promote free trade the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy Seize the global initiative The new global trade negotiations we helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in 2005 The United States has led the way in completing the accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade Organization We will assist Russia s preparations to join the WTO Press regional initiatives The United States and other democracies in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas targeted for completion in 2005 This year the United States will advocate market access negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement We will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent Africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and leading to free trade Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements Building on the free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001 the Administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world Initially Central America Southern Africa Morocco and Australia will be our principal focal points Renew the executive congressional partnership Every administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with Congress After a gap of 8 years the Administration reestablished majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002 This Administration will work with Congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade Promotion Authority Promote the connection between trade and development Trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries The United States is implementing The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of sub Saharan Africa We will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities Beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV AIDS tuberculosis and malaria Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices Commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the European Union Canada and Mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture Laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping International industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred Help domestic industries and workers adjust There is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the American steel industry The benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices These safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American workers Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets Protect the environment and workers The United States must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity We will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into U S trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO and use the International Labor Organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade Enhance energy security We will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the Western Hemisphere Africa Central Asia and the Caspian region We will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate Our overall objective is to reduce America s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years by the year 2012 Our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic U N Framework Convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for U S cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of 4 5 billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a 700 million increase over last year s budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as China and India so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path VII Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy In World War II we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens President Bush Washington D C Inter American Development Bank March 14 2002 A world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day is neither just nor stable Including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of U S international policy Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries Worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery Results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients These are the indicators of a failed strategy Working with other nations the United States is confronting this failure We forged a new consensus at the U N Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change This Administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies Where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance The United States and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform We propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the United States While continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom Governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship The Millennium Challenge Account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development banks in raising living standards The United States is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor We have reversed the downward trend in U S contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U S contributions to the International Development Association IDA the World Bank s fund for the poorest countries and the African Development Fund The key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries We will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development Every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor When it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families We have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results For this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals Thanks to U S leadership the recent IDA replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress For the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the achievement of actual development results and part of the U S contribution is linked in this way We will strive to make sure that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans Greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens As a result of U S leadership the recent IDA agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education HIV AIDS health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs Our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks We will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results Open societies to commerce and investment Trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth Even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment An effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy Secure public health The scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like HIV AIDS malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained Resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure The United States has strongly backed the new global fund for HIV AIDS organized by U N Secretary General Kofi Annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care The United States already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor If the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more Emphasize education Literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources are devoted to education This proportion should grow The United States will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in Africa The United States can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by AIDS Continue to aid agricultural development New technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water Using sound science the United States should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people including 300 million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition VIII Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power We have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom Effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in Canada and Europe Europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter European security and the European Union EU our partner in opening world trade The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO as NATO itself recognized when it invoked its Article V self defense clause for the first time NATO s core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but NATO must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances NATO must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under NATO s own mandate as well as contributing to mission based coalitions To achieve this we must expand NATO s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the Cold War We will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests At the same time we welcome our European allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the EU and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO We cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come The attacks of September 11 energized America s Asian alliances Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an attack on Australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for Operation Enduring Freedom Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack We have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand The war against terrorism has proven that America s alliances in Asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges To enhance our Asian alliances and friendships we will look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term build on 50 years of U S Australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition Several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly Russia India and China In all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape With Russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the United States and Russia are no longer strategic adversaries The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the Euro Atlantic community and the United States Russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses They understand increasingly that Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism We are facilitating Russia s entry into the World Trade Organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations We have created the NATO Russia Council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among Russia our European allies and ourselves We will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce Russia s growing commitment to integration into the Euro Atlantic community At the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership Lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our relations Russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern Russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation Nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with India based on a conviction that U S interests require a strong relationship with India We are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well We have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean Finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia Differences remain including over the development of India s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of India s economic reforms But while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about India today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests Through a strong partnership with India we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future The United States relationship with China is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous Asia Pacific region We welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous China The democratic development of China is crucial to that future Yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the Communist legacy China s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the Asia Pacific region China is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness In time China will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing China We already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean peninsula Likewise we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns Shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of HIV AIDS challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights China has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the Communist Party To make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done Only by allowing the Chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can China reach its full potential Our important trade relationship will benefit from China s entry into the World Trade Organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers workers and companies China is our fourth largest trading partner with over 100 billion in annual two way trade The power of market principles and the WTO s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens There are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements Our commitment to the self defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one Human rights is another We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments We will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree The events of September 11 2001 fundamentally changed the context for relations between the United States and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities With our long standing allies in Europe and Asia and with leaders in Russia India and China we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge We can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action In the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress IX Transform America s National Security Institutions to Meet the Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty First Century Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity They did not touch its source America is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people President Bush Washington D C Joint Session of Congress September 20 2001 The major institutions of American national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements All of them must be transformed It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge Our military s highest priority is to defend the United States To do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against U S interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions However the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces A military structured to deter massive Cold War era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the U S commitments to allies and friends Through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of U S forces Before the war in Afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies Yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces We must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure U S access to distant theaters and protect critical U S infrastructure and assets in outer space Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting U S intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention Finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the President with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the United States our allies and our friends We know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred The United States must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the United States our allies or our friends We will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the United States Intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states Designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the Soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats Intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends We need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us Those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security Since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the United States we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement Initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to lead the development and actions of the Nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend America s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy The State Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments And in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions Officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes As humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems Effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by American readiness to play our part Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand America The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations It does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the Muslim world This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the International Criminal Court ICC whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans and which we do not accept We will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect U S nationals from the ICC We will implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U S personnel and officials We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this war At home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the American people Today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing In a globalized world events beyond America s borders have a greater impact inside them Our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe The characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism This vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks As time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons This is a new condition of life We will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it In exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners Still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require When we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives We will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values Ultimately the foundation of American strength is at home It is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions A diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy Our strength comes from what we do with that energy That is where our national security begins ,2695,13302,hamnspam\ham

http media guardian co uk broadcast comment 0 7493 781769 00 html Hamza s horrid but we must tolerate him Rod Liddle Wednesday August 28 2002 The Guardian Sheikh Abu Hamza al Masri our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in Victoria Park Hackney I ve often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays Head for the beach and maybe swing by B Q on the way home I had hoped I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the sea an ice cream cone in his one good hand the waves tickling his shins and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and maybe me and you too But B Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza s budget since the Bank of England froze his assets so Victoria Park had to do But he sounded happy enough when I spoke to him with the babble of tiny cheerful Islamic proto warriors in the background You must know Hamza he s the imam designed it would seem by the Daily Mail s cartoonist Mac Large metal hook in place of a left hand One eye covered by a patch the other a baleful watchful milky white We don t mock the disabled any more these days unless it s someone like Hamza whom we don t like then if you ll excuse the inapt phraseology the gloves come off So Hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of the British right as Captain Hook in articles which usually call for his arrest or extradition to the US or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe off to Pakistan or Afghanistan where he fought the Russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities anywhere really just out of here And if we can t lock him up or chuck him out of the country maybe we can force him to shut up Because we don t like Hamza very much We weren t that fond of him before September 11 but afterwards in that nervy paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in our disapprobation turned into political persecution And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they ve got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam All out of context and a very long time ago says the imam not unduly bothered But perhaps he should be because our reputation for broad mindedness and tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror s scoop Hamza preaches or preached at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque so earlier this year the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks I didn t know Charity Commissioners were meant to do stuff like that He has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been frozen He is tailed by the police every now and then and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press And this last point is because we tell ourselves endlessly repeating the mantra over and over again and fervently wishing it to be true Hamza is not representative of British Muslims as if British Muslims were a simple homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation And perhaps succour The trouble is in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more representative than the list of those government approved Muslim spokesmen who were uncomfortably I suspect dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4 s Today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush s crusade One in six were to put it mildly ambivalent about the attack on the US the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally A large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against Islam Which is what Hamza said repeatedly But it was something that at the time we didn t want to hear Now if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across superficially at least as someone from the liberal left No war against Iraq Britain to become independent of US foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states stronger action against Israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth Nor is he particularly anti semitic so far as I can tell although I don t suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year In yesterday s Guardian the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful for the sheikh s message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented he is without question rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public His ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam he would be happy in a truly Islamic society to stone women to death for adultery for example You and I would find many perhaps most of his views utterly repellent And that s the point Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural Multiculturalism is not surely the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism Multiculturalism is rather the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture and maybe learn from them The FBI has been investigating Hamza but of course has found nothing remotely incriminating The real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally This is a perfectly noble argument but it does not wash You don t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn t exist And if British Muslims maybe a minority maybe not feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy it is not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza Shutting the man up therefore won t make a difference It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it The glass is falling hour by hour the glass will fall for ever But if you break the bloody glass you won t hold up the weather Yahoo Groups Sponsor 4 DVDs Free s p Join

expedia for availability from March 26 to 29 4 nights wednesday thorugh saturday I ve also started contacting hotels for group rates some of the group rates are no better than the regular rates and they require signing a contract with a minimum number of rooms sold with someone financially responsible for unbooked rooms Most hotels are less than responsive Radission Barcelo Hotel DuPont Circle 125 night 99 weekend State Plaza hotel Foggy Bottom near GWU 119 night 99 weekend Hilton Silver Spring Near Metro in suburban MD 99 hight 74 weekend Windsor Park Hotel Conn Ave between DuPont Circle Woodley Park Metro stations 95 night needs a car Econo Lodge Alexandria Near Metro in suburban VA 95 night This is a hand picked list I ignored anything over 125 night even though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates Also I m not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia only discount I can t vouch for any of these hotels either I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid june through mid september and mid november through mid january Z This one has no MIME structure nor HTML It even has a Content disposition which is counted as a non spam clue It got f p ed because of the many hospitality related and money related terms I m surprised 125 night and similar aren t clues too And again several spam clues are duplicated with different variations hotel hotels hotels subject Hotel rates rates WRT hating HTML possibilities include 1 It really had to do with something other than MIME HTML 2 These are pure HTML not multipart alternative with a text plain part so that the tags aren t getting stripped The pickled classifier despises all hints of HTML due to its c l py heritage 3 These are multipart alternative with a text plain part but the latter doesn t contain the same text as the text html part for example as Anthony reported perhaps the text plain part just says something like This is an HMTL message If it s 2 it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize meaning even if it is pure HTML strip the tags anyway In fact I d like to do that and default it to True The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists strikes me as umm extreme wink I also looked in more detail at some f p s in my geeks traffic The first one s a doozie that s the term right It has lots of HTML clues that are apparently ignored It

Not fortean but a moment in time all the same http news bbc co uk 1 hi entertainment film 2220972 stm Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS Betamax s manufacturer Sony has announced that it will make only 2 000 more machines for the Japanese market They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998 VHS became the dominant format by the mid 1980s Betamax was launched in 1975 and won many fans who said it was better quality than its VHS rival Some 2 3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year 1984 but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the film rental industry and in homes Just 2 800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002 With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the market demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to secure parts Sony said in a statement Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the format The professional Betamax format Betacam is still widely used in the television and film industries and will be unaffected But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin for Betamax home players In the 1980s many video rental chains preferred the VHS format Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988 The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS Betaphiles say although VHS tapes had a longer duration A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world but no new ones will be made after the end of 2002 Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies See also Yahoo Groups Sponsor Kwick Pick Portable Lock Pick Opens Almost Any Lock Locked out Try the Kwick Pick For 17 95 you can open car doors desk drawers padlocks and much more Never get locked out again http us click yahoo com O2sPyA p6kEAA MVfIAA 7gSolB TM To unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe egroups com Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to http docs yahoo com info terms ,246,404,hamnspam\ham
I ll agree that webforms are a pain in the ass however it would seem to me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the autoform function providing more info than you want to That and some entity would be holding the passport info thus have all that data in the first place Personally i d never trust them not to at least use it internally to market to me if not sell rent out Just think of the ability they d have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was tracked to you And thats just the marketing side of it Chris On Sat 28 Sep 2002 Gregory Alan Bolcer wrote What s wrong with doing business over the Web Web forms There s promising replacements forms but this is the current state of the industry o You find something that you want to fill out It s a partnership form a signup for a Web seminar a request for more information anything o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops just to get a small piece of information whitepaper or a callback when halfway through you start to wonder if it s really worth your time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world listed the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you to hit submit but due to the layout the more tag on the second row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except about two dozen third world countries o Even worse ever time you hit submit all forms based things complain about using the universal country phone number format and will cause you to re enter dashes instead of dots o When you get something that s not entered right you will go back and enter it right but then some other field or most likely pulldown will automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to go back and resent that freaking thing too Finally after all combinations of all pulldowns you may get a successful submit o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation o Sometimes like today you won t be able to ever submit anything due to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that is internally non conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their forms submission What s wrong with this picture The company is screwing you by wasting your time enforcing their data collection standards on you I m sure there s someone in that company that would be willing to accept US U S USA United States U of A America etc and would know exactly which freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them to waste even more time playing Web form geography I m starting to see the light of Passport You want more information Hit this passport button Voila IE6 and Netscape 6 7 have pre forms sutff but I always turn it off because you never know when there s that one field that you don t want to submit to the person you are submitting to that automatically gets sent i e the privacy stuff is well beyond the average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff So if crappy forms based submission is the state of practice for business enablement on the Web I can t see this whole data submission and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as working all that well Greg ,322,643,hamnspam\ham

 Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty I m not a socio political history buff does anybody have some clear examples Original Message From Rohit Khare khare alumni caltech edu To fork example com Sent Friday September 20 2002 5 10 PM Subject sed s United States Roman Empire g A world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day is neither just nor stable Absolutely correct Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on Earth today The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy that bears close reading It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations It does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the Muslim world This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa our new music and news channel for 15 30 year old Arabs It s 1 in practically every market it s entered nearing 90 listenership in Amman And it s even beginning to be trusted for news well past BBC and taking share from every other government broadcaster It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term Many of you may disagree but I found the document below surprisingly centrist If you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re ICC Taiwan Relations Act etc But still this is as much a Democratic platform as not Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared they might As you read replace United States with Roman Empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history I don t know how proud to be about that but it is telling Sometime I daydream that the President might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700 military installations overseas and what they do for us It would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us Heck I d love to see a real time map of Federal expenditures around the globe a softly glowing necklace of embassies carriers arctic research stations hotels golf courses warehouses libraries clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy Of course this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the Bush Doctrine for pre emptive strikes I d sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world Rohit September 20 2002 Full Text Bush s National Security Strategy Following is the full text of President Bush s new national security strategy The document entitled The National Security Strategy of the United States will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of the Administration s policy INTRODUCTION THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise In the twenty first century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity People everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor These values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages Today the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence In keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty By making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better We will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government Today that task has changed dramatically Enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America Now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror And America will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization The United States and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases Together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination The United States will not allow these efforts to succeed We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery We will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies And as a matter of common sense and self defense America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act In the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action As we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace Today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war Today the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos The United States will build on these common interests to promote global security We are also increasingly united by common values Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth In time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness America will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement Finally the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world The events of September 11 2001 taught us that weak states like Afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers Yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the United States will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity The United States will deliver greater development assistance through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of AIDS and other infectious diseases In building a balance of power that favors freedom the United States is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent For freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations the World Trade Organization the Organization of American States and NATO as well as other long standing alliances Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions In all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously They are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment Freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization Throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease Today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission I Overview of America s International Strategy Our Nation s cause has always been larger than our Nation s defense We fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 The United States possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world Sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom For most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality That great struggle is over The militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few We must defeat these threats to our Nation allies and friends This is also a time of opportunity for America We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty The U S national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better Our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity And this path is not America s alone It is open to all To achieve these goals the United States will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform America s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century II Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong I disagree Different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 In pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere No nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them Fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence No people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property These demands can be met in many ways America s constitution has served us well Many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance History has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals But even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were there to guide us As a result America is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society Today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty And when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991 or in Belgrade in 2000 When we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in the Republic of Korea and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin America and Africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the United States must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty Our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources They will guide our actions and our words in international bodies We will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it III Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends Just three days removed from these events Americans do not yet have the distance of history But our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder This nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger The conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others It will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing President Bush Washington D C The National Cathedral September 14 2001 The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology The enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents In many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace Such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process But no cause justifies terror The United States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them We make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals Afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al Qaida But it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America South America Europe Africa the Middle East and across Asia Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists Once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism We will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks However this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction WMD or their precursors defending the United States the American people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism This includes using the full influence of the United States and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the Muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening America s homeland security to protect against and deter attack This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council and the Department of Defense Centered on a new Department of Homeland Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the FBI our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity For example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards Our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers Our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic While our focus is protecting America we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends Wherever possible the United States will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism Where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the United Nations as well as non governmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists In the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life Freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict In leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century IV Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts We build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small President Bush Berlin Germany May 23 2002 Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering In an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity When violence erupts and states falter the United States will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U S action direct or indirect is warranted We have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities The United States will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind The United States should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge The United States should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves Where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles The Israeli Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of America s close relationship with the state of Israel and key Arab states and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the United States There can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine living beside Israel in peace and security Like all other people Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes The United States will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict The United States the international donor community and the World Bank stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary If Palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine Permanent occupation threatens Israel s identity and democracy So the United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible Palestinian state As there is progress towards security Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28 2000 And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop As violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life The United States can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them In South Asia the United States has also emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes This administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and Pakistan These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute With Pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society The Administration sees India s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly Our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law By tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets Indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation It is the initiative by Indonesia that allows U S assistance to make a difference In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly Mexico Brazil Canada Chile and Colombia Together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope We will work with regional institutions such as the Summit of the Americas process the Organization of American States OAS and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices This conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the United States Therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country In Colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups We are working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the Colombian people In Africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty This threatens both a core value of the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror American interests and American principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity Together with our European allies we must help strengthen Africa s fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones Forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats Africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing This administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South Africa Nigeria Kenya and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with European allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and Africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub Saharan Africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference The transition to the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent V Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us Our Allies and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass Destruction The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations Our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons They want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War our security environment has undergone profound transformation Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with Russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union However the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make today s security environment more complex and dangerous In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes These states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it stands At the time of the Gulf War we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against Iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents In the past decade North Korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal Other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well These states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends Our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes Proactive counterproliferation efforts We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed We must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems Counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD armed adversaries Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction We will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials We will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs The recent G 8 agreement to commit up to 20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD use whether by terrorists or hostile states Minimizing the effects of WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends The United States must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past The inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of today s threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option We cannot let our enemies strike first In the Cold War especially following the Cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo risk averse adversary Deterrence was an effective defense But deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations In the Cold War weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them Today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors These weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states Such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness The overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to action For centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries Rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means They know such attacks would fail Instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11 2001 mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security The greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the United States will if necessary act preemptively The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather We will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions To support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the United States or our allies and friends The reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just VI Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free Trade When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough When nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively President Bush Monterrey Mexico March 22 2002 A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world Economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America s shores All governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge We will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity The lessons of history are clear market economies not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty Policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U S national security interests We want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security European efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are Japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the Japanese banking system We will continue to use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners including through the Group of Seven G 7 to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth International flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies These flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty Our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost To this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets We will work actively with other countries the International Monetary Fund IMF and the private sector to implement the G 7 Action Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing so We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy The concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics If you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them If others make something that you value you should be able to buy it This is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living To promote free trade the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy Seize the global initiative The new global trade negotiations we helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in 2005 The United States has led the way in completing the accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade Organization We will assist Russia s preparations to join the WTO Press regional initiatives The United States and other democracies in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas targeted for completion in 2005 This year the United States will advocate market access negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement We will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent Africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and leading to free trade Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements Building on the free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001 the Administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world Initially Central America Southern Africa Morocco and Australia will be our principal focal points Renew the executive congressional partnership Every administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with Congress After a gap of 8 years the Administration reestablished majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002 This Administration will work with Congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade Promotion Authority Promote the connection between trade and development Trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries The United States is implementing The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of sub Saharan Africa We will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities Beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV AIDS tuberculosis and malaria Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices Commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the European Union Canada and Mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture Laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping International industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred Help domestic industries and workers adjust There is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the American steel industry The benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices These safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American workers Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets Protect the environment and workers The United States must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity We will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into U S trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO and use the International Labor Organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade Enhance energy security We will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the Western Hemisphere Africa Central Asia and the Caspian region We will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate Our overall objective is to reduce America s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years by the year 2012 Our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic U N Framework Convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for U S cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of 4 5 billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a 700 million increase over last year s budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as China and India so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path VII Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy In World War II we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens President Bush Washington D C Inter American Development Bank March 14 2002 A world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than 2 a day is neither just nor stable Including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of U S international policy Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries Worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery Results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients These are the indicators of a failed strategy Working with other nations the United States is confronting this failure We forged a new consensus at the U N Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change This Administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies Where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance The United States and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform We propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the United States While continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom Governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship The Millennium Challenge Account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development banks in raising living standards The United States is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor We have reversed the downward trend in U S contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U S contributions to the International Development Association IDA the World Bank s fund for the poorest countries and the African Development Fund The key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries We will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development Every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor When it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families We have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results For this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals Thanks to U S leadership the recent IDA replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress For the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the achievement of actual development results and part of the U S contribution is linked in this way We will strive to make sure that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans Greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens As a result of U S leadership the recent IDA agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education HIV AIDS health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs Our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks We will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results Open societies to commerce and investment Trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth Even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment An effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy Secure public health The scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like HIV AIDS malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained Resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure The United States has strongly backed the new global fund for HIV AIDS organized by U N Secretary General Kofi Annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care The United States already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor If the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more Emphasize education Literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources are devoted to education This proportion should grow The United States will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in Africa The United States can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by AIDS Continue to aid agricultural development New technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water Using sound science the United States should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people including 300 million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition VIII Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power We have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war President Bush West Point New York June 1 2002 America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom Effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in Canada and Europe Europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter European security and the European Union EU our partner in opening world trade The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO as NATO itself recognized when it invoked its Article V self defense clause for the first time NATO s core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but NATO must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances NATO must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under NATO s own mandate as well as contributing to mission based coalitions To achieve this we must expand NATO s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the Cold War We will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests At the same time we welcome our European allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the EU and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO We cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come The attacks of September 11 energized America s Asian alliances Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an attack on Australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for Operation Enduring Freedom Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack We have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand The war against terrorism has proven that America s alliances in Asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges To enhance our Asian alliances and friendships we will look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term build on 50 years of U S Australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition Several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly Russia India and China In all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape With Russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the United States and Russia are no longer strategic adversaries The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the Euro Atlantic community and the United States Russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses They understand increasingly that Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism We are facilitating Russia s entry into the World Trade Organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations We have created the NATO Russia Council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among Russia our European allies and ourselves We will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce Russia s growing commitment to integration into the Euro Atlantic community At the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership Lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our relations Russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern Russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation Nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with India based on a conviction that U S interests require a strong relationship with India We are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well We have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean Finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia Differences remain including over the development of India s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of India s economic reforms But while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about India today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests Through a strong partnership with India we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future The United States relationship with China is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous Asia Pacific region We welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous China The democratic development of China is crucial to that future Yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the Communist legacy China s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the Asia Pacific region China is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness In time China will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing China We already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean peninsula Likewise we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns Shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of HIV AIDS challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights China has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the Communist Party To make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done Only by allowing the Chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can China reach its full potential Our important trade relationship will benefit from China s entry into the World Trade Organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers workers and companies China is our fourth largest trading partner with over 100 billion in annual two way trade The power of market principles and the WTO s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens There are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements Our commitment to the self defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one Human rights is another We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments We will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree The events of September 11 2001 fundamentally changed the context for relations between the United States and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities With our long standing allies in Europe and Asia and with leaders in Russia India and China we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge We can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action In the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress IX Transform America s National Security Institutions to Meet the Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty First Century Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity They did not touch its source America is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people President Bush Washington D C Joint Session of Congress September 20 2001 The major institutions of American national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements All of them must be transformed It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge Our military s highest priority is to defend the United States To do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against U S interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions However the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces A military structured to deter massive Cold War era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the U S commitments to allies and friends Through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of U S forces Before the war in Afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies Yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces We must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure U S access to distant theaters and protect critical U S infrastructure and assets in outer space Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting U S intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention Finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the President with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the United States our allies and our friends We know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred The United States must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the United States our allies or our friends We will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the United States Intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states Designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the Soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats Intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends We need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us Those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security Since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the United States we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement Initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to lead the development and actions of the Nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend America s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy The State Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments And in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions Officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes As humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems Effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by American readiness to play our part Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand America The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations It does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the Muslim world This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the International Criminal Court ICC whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans and which we do not accept We will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect U S nationals from the ICC We will implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U S personnel and officials We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this war At home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the American people Today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing In a globalized world events beyond America s borders have a greater impact inside them Our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe The characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism This vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks As time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons This is a new condition of life We will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it In exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners Still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require When we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives We will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values Ultimately the foundation of American strength is at home It is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions A diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy Our strength comes from what we do with that energy That is where our national security begins ,2695,13302,hamnspam\ham

 All else being equal the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of air density Air density drops off pretty quickly and I really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that I think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of the atmosphere trails off Chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity resulting in the potential energy for a mass M to be linear in height h Mgh What relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium If they are at the same height we will have half the mass in one and half the mass in the other and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction 0 If they are at differing heights then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends In order for the two flows to balance the higher packet must contain less air than the lower and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly high percentage of thin air low percentage of dense air Now rates are exponential in energy differences 1 so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height to compensate How does it go in practice Dave 0 How well does it balance Chemical equilibria seem stable as they deal with very large numbers over a very long time Economic equilibria are viewed from the mayfly standpoint of individual people and so at best the shot noise is very visible 1 That is to say rates will be exponential in the free energy differences between endpoints and a transition state We can ignore that complication in this model ,169,314,hamnspam\ham

Gordon Mohr It was clear you were talking about averages But it should be equally clear that that isn t what people mean when they use the word promiscuity Sigh This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of female monkeys with males other than the alpha male i e specifically not the tail end of the distribution By mating with as many extra group males as possible female langurs ensure etc OK then Consider a population of 1 000 000 500 000 men each pair off with 500 000 women Then 1 man let s call him Wilt also has sex with the other 499 999 women This has never happened Its relevance is nil Averages are useful sure but much more so if called by their actual name rather than conflated with another concept So I chose not to type on average explicitly in my post since this is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue There is no disagreement between us except that I am more interested in typical behaviour and you in extreme Actually you probably just had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it EOT AFAIC R ,156,208,hamnspam\ham
 Original Message From Crispin Cowan mailto crispin wirex com Sent Wednesday September 04 2002 7 30 PM To Ben Mord Cc Webappsec Securityfocus Com SECPROG Securityfocus Subject Re use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks Ben Mord wrote Original Message From Crispin Cowan mailto crispin wirex com Sent Wednesday September 04 2002 5 46 PM To Ben Mord Cc Webappsec Securityfocus Com SECPROG Securityfocus Subject Re use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks Ben Mord wrote My proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be less ambitious The idea is that you never commit instead you simply revert to base state on reboot Ah In that case you can use something considerably less powerful than VMWare All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD ROM But RAM is expensive and the directory structures of many systems e g Windows are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical Even if you are fortunate enough to be using Linux or another FHS compliant nix you still can t fit a lot on a CD Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of static multimedia content on the web server This particular problem can be alleviated somewhat by using DVDs but this is a temporary solution at best which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard drives become cheaper Obviously you can t do this with partitions that accrue important state e g a partition that stores database table data but if you do want some state to persist then you need a mountable writable partition To protect it you need some kind of access control management to decide who can do what to the writable partition blah blah blah and before you know it the security problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers Right This is why you would consolidate all state of any long term significance on just a couple partitions and why you would not put static application code on these changeable partitions Fortunately most large client server application physical architectures do this anyhow because these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different sets of administrative security RAID and backup requirements People also tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular with the GUI at one end business logic in the middle and persistence services at the other This logical architecture maps naturally to a physical architecture that has a static web server a static application server and a database server that has static and changeable partitions I use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable because the unchangeable partitions might be written to for temporary swap space Who knows what Windows does internally My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image partition and a temporary delta image partition that has some simple but solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of base images and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the server is rebooted If some vendor wished to implement this they could then market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer overflows platform and middleware bugs etc The prevention of unauthorized modification of application data of course would not be addressed by this particular product But there are many other techniques out there to defend application data But those techniques all assume that your system itself has not been compromised at a lower level which is where this product could help I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a hardware RAID vendor to implement I m just guessing of course with no knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally If anyone knows of such a product I d love to hear about it Ben ,336,710,hamnspam\ham

I have some patches that seem to fix avoid this problem now It is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails long enough for UPS s to run out and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply First I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring so that if exmh is attempting for any reason to expand a sequence that isn t either a number or a range of numbers or a list of such things it will simply ignore the trash rather than giving a traceback This one solves the initial problem mh tcl WAS Thu Aug 22 21 15 06 2002 mh tcl Wed Aug 28 12 39 11 2002 487 6 487 10 set seq set rseq foreach range split string trim sequence if regexp 0 9 0 9 range just ignore anything bogus continue set parts split string trim range if llength parts 1 lappend seq parts That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring before the code assumes that range is either NNN or NNN MMM so we should probably make sure that s true issue an error instead of just continue if you like but I don t think an error is needed But that just allowed me to create a similar problem in another place by typing NNN and rather than continue to fight fires like this I thought I should think more about Brent s suggestion But rather than have the selection code actually validate the input which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid I decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input so I just stuck a catch around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed This way any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal maybe allowing a sequence name like prev or next or anything else can be handled just there without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it But while I was playing there I noticed something I never new before If you type 66 the 66 changes to 67 and so on for each that is typed I suspect that s perhaps an artifact of is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number so let it mean but now I found it I think its nice But if we can type 66 why not 66 as well That kind of limitation bugs me so I fixed it And then I wondered about folders with names containing the special use of as the toggle character means there s no way to type those from the keyboard So I fixed that as well This makes two different restrictions there s no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway so I doubt this will bother anyone and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current target folder name when the name being typed is empty I m less happy about that part but I think I can live with it in order to allow folder names with s in them to exist and be typed Then since I was there anyway I decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me In normal keyboard mode s is the key used to show a message But if you ve just typed 123 and the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message and you want to now show that message you can t type s you have to type r instead So I fixed this one as well Fixed here is in quotes as it assumes that the keybinding for MsgShow is s if you change that to something else it will remain s in here I don t know enough tk tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here r continues to work of course And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code I also made it clear the status line if you abort message folder entry mode C or G Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings In any case what follows is the patch that does all of that I believe that if you apply this then the one above is probably not needed the catch around the MsgShow will hide the problem I don t think we really need to fix Brent s way of invoking it Or include it anyway just for completeness I haven t run an exmh with the following patch but not the previous one so I don t know for sure that all will be OK then kre select tcl WAS Thu Aug 22 21 15

Mr FoRK writes Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the Internet as with Napster or Freenet In fact the caching in XDegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems users with high bandwidth connections can download portions or stripes of a file from several cached locations simultaneously The XDegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original A key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file which is stored as an HTTP header for the file This more sophisticated than Napster or Freenet part seems to be the same behavior implemented in many other P2P CDNs such as Kazaa EDonkey Overnet BitTorrent Gnutella with HUGE extensions OnionNetworks WebRAID though the quality of the digest used by each system varies wildly Gordon ,102,148,hamnspam\ham

 the historical record by which you mean human historical record is highly overrated nigh worthless when you are talking about geological timescales even on topics with as short a timescale as climate There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity starting around the industrialization of Europe and accelerating after WWII Most scientists studying global climate change believe that these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for increased global warming Hence our interest in items of human time scale It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization The receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years I don t see any compelling reason to save the glaciers anyway particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the past have often been much warmer than today The point of global warming isn t to save the Earth the planet is not sentient The point is to understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on global human activity For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another I ll just stick with Occam s Razor for now The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy This is the current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus If the CO2 concentration goes up globally which it has then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy This process may be slow and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide I encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to eventual increases in global energy content part of which will be evident as heat Jim ,223,390,hamnspam\ham

This is for those that have interacted with D Winer Dave s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around You re supposed to just shut up and take it http winerlog inspiredsites net Who s the real monster It seems good Ol Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him It seems Ben Kevin and Bill are making too strong a case So here we Dave s attempt to fool you into thinking they re some sort of monsters violent ones no less Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters who will stoop to any level to get their way Yeah sure Dave whatever you need to believe The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving RSS in general Each with their own brand of attitude to be sure but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward How is that being monstrous Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public s perception of them If you haven t already contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness 9 18 02 10 07 38 AM Discuss Dave deflects what he can t take the time to understand It s really quite pitiful When normal people don t understand something they usually try learning about it They read up ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it This before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools What Dave does is just the opposite Posts a link to something he doesn t understand Get s a bunch of e mail from people who do understand it Derides the idea as being too much trouble and blogs it Expects others to do research for him Abuses anyone who tries to help him Pontificates incorrectly about only part of the issue Realizes he s been a fool but refuses to correct himself Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy Tries making the educated people look like fools Sends private e mails to them trying to scare them off Exposes any private e mail they write out of context Deflects and runs off to some new topic repeats from 1 His continued diatribes about RSS 1 0 and it s use of RDF reveal this to be true Dave doesn t get the idea of the semantic web He d rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying One reader wrote to us with a good analogy It s like that movie The Poseidon Adventure Dave s like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow I don t know about you but I d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room The ship s fucking sinking and I don t want to be following the idiot Dave s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around You re supposed to just shut up and take it After all why would good ol Uncle Dave want to hurt you It s all about love right To hell with asking you if you want to get shafted And if you dare complain he savages you Then he tries to make everyone think you re the one causing all the trouble We ve news for you Dave we re wise to your tactics and we re talking amongst ourselves about it We re routing around you damaging behavoir That s where we re coming from If you have an example of how you ve tried to help Dave please drop us an e mail about it We ll keep it strictly confidential of course Send it along to zaphod egroups com 9 12 02 10 13 11 AM Discuss Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig The trouble is you get dirty and the pig seems to like it Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it s fundamentally impossible His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web developers are doing a terrible job In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering that guy is an idiot The zaphodim however are veteran pig wrestlers If you ve got a similar tale from the mud pit be sure to drop us a line at zaphod egroups com 9 11 02 2 17 58 PM Discuss 1 response Aha Some backing down by the whining one It would appear the dictator release strategy that Dave s been trying on his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support I m going to push back the caveat removing on the 2 0 spec by 24 hours Still have work to do on the sample file I want to look into the RFC for time date specs and get started on the Radio implementation of 2 0 I have to prepare for Seybold tomorrow and I want to a little memorial for 9 11 A busy few days for a guy still recovering Also it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 2 0 spec and see if there are any deal stoppers Hell yeah there are deal stoppers like nobody wants it nor will they use it The poor Radio customers The poor Salon blog users They re going to be dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use So with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card What utter fucking nonsense This past weekend the blogosphere excoriates him for his blame America bullshit Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of RSS Now he s trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he s still recovering Uh Dave if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights We ll still kick your ass regardless That s what years of your abusing people has gotten you Dave No sympathy anymore none whatsoever 9 11 02 1 56 10 PM Discuss Dave is Scary on 9 11 Posted on Scripting News on 9 10 2002 Note During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News I ll be in SF at Seybold leading a discussion on Web Services for Publishing with people from Amazon Apple Google and Jake Savin of UserLand I may be able to update my Radio weblog but only if there s something really important to report So best wishes for a happy and safe 9 11 What kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9 11 Obviously someone who doesn t have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy 9 11 02 7 56 06 AM Discuss Yeow and we though we were harsh Wow apparently Dave s sticking his neck out quite far these days Craig Schamp practically keel hauls him with this one He wraps it up with The man seems to show over and over that he s nothing more than a whining buffoon Give that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring Related links over at PhotoDude Richard Bennett Andrea Harris Reid Stott Jeff Jarvis Ipse Dixit and the Fat Guy 9 9 02 12 29 45 PM Discuss RSS 2 0 code name Hitler If Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2 0 through without formal community consensus here now we call it the Hitler release of 2 0 No objections No he means No objections I choose to hear Dave is simply not listening People are objecting all over 9 6 02 9 00 02 AM Discuss Referral log funnies Every now and then we check the referral logs to see what s pointing back to us We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search 9 5 02 12 15 07 PM Discuss Luserland Attempts to Trademark RSS Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt Scripting News is full of examples So we found it surprising as did many others when Luserland software tried to patent the term RSS back in 2000 Here s the patent application http tarr uspto gov servlet tarr regser serial entry 78025336 This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1 0 development efforts and the publication of the specification Winer knew about the RSS 1 0 stuff indeed he complained about it bitterly at the time Could Dave be any more transparent Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do A good quote from before he filed the patent application Tim O Reilly says patents are OK he s just against stupid patents In the spirit of Touch of Grey Tim man patents are lock in of the worst kind There s no way to route around them 9 4 02 6 06 51 AM Discuss When s a Permalink not a Permalink When Dave writes an item then removes it The permalink links to nothing at that point So apparently the perma part in permalink is permanent For everyone except Dave Too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this 9 2 02 6 16 03 PM Discuss ,712,1652,hamnspam\ham

 You have multiple generations of peasants squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a human parts of the property package When I d read that getting legal title can take 20 years when I believe that 1 year ought to be more than sufficient and helped by the Cairo reference I d assumed that we were talking about the urban poor If I see people living in mansions or even in suburban subdivisions I assume they didn t have too much trouble with their titles If I see people living in shanties and haphazard alleyways I tend to assume their parcels weren t exactly recorded on the government maps or paid for with a bank loan especially when nearby vacant lots have shotgun wielding men presumably intent on keeping them development free Now it may be that Manhattanites view of America to say that outside of Metro Manila Davao and maybe another city or two Cebu everything else literally is the boondocks But going on that very broad assumption I guess I m describing the flip side of Mr Roger s experience the paisanos who leave behind those who remain on a patron s rural land move to Manila and the second assumption squat in shantytowns there at least until they can line up a middle class job So going on two large assumptions I can come up with a scenario under which title would take 20 years a shantytown arises somewhere in the midst of a section or whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the land and it takes decades of arguing to put together a package which somehow can both compensate the owner and record lots for the inhabitants Just transferring title to an existing lot between parties who have money ought not to be a problem The obvious solution at least to us barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK is to introduce market mechanisms It is left as an exercise to come up with one which works when many of the agents are perceived to have negligible NPV Dave land reform meant that all the agricultural producers had to plant crops all the time profitable or not What happened to more highly capitalized land Putting in trees instead of crops sounds like it might sidestep that Mr Long I think you d particularly enjoy the De Soto work On the to find list Any chance of an explanation of that Bell Jar in the meantime http xent com mailman listinfo fork ,262,417,hamnspam\ham

performance requirements of data intensive environments and enterprise applications With a point to point connection architecture and rich command set for managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface serial ATA advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface The interface s reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with increased design flexibility and hot plug capability Maxtor s MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that has previously been too expensive to keep on disk said Dave Reinsel analyst at IDC The ATA drives offer a great value low cost per GB and when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling cost effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives which have been the traditional solutions used for near line applications Availability Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II are now available with volume units available in the fourth quarter Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003 About Maxtor Maxtor Corporation www maxtor com is one of the world s leading suppliers of information

If it s not stateful it wouldn t seem to be worth the effort although I guess it might help with DDoS attacks Sounds snake oilish to me but I m biased by lots of experience with firewalls and proxy servers and the limitations thereof Ken Original Message From Rohit Khare mailto khare alumni caltech edu Sent Tuesday August 27 2002 5 00 PM To fork example com Subject DataPower announces XML in silicon No analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet But here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on Best Rohit DataPower delivers XML acceleration device By Scott Tyler Shafer August 27 2002 5 46 am PT DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process XML data Unlike competing solutions that process XML data in software DataPower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials The new device dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the Cambridge Mass based startup The DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called XG3 that does the analysis parsing and processing of the XML data According to Steve Kelly CEO of DataPower the XA35 Accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML the anticipated future proliferation of Web services and as a means to share data between two businesses Our vision is to build out an XML aware infrastructure Kelly said The XA35 is the first of a family Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up to 20 times This he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers DataPower believes an inline device is the best alternative In addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of XML Today s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only Kelly said A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall Firewalls are blind to XML today Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as Web services proliferate Kelly said According to DataPower most existing solutions to offload XML processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security After trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process XML in hardware Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code said Kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does Kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do XML processing claims that he believes will be mostly false Other content aware switches such as SSL secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first 64 bytes of a packet while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection looking at 1 400 bytes and thus enabling greater processing of XML data Kelly explained The 1U high network device has been tested against a large collection of XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are XML Kelly said In addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor This deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market Startup Sarvega based in Burr Ridge Ill introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in May and earlier this month Tarari an Intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration The DataPower device is now available priced starting at 54 995 The company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks Long before industry interest in XML grew Kuznetsov assembled a team of world class M I T engineers and designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing XML The first such solution was a software interpreter called DGXT This software based approach to XML processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software based accelerators Kuznetsov s team raised the bar and designed a system for processing XML in purpose built hardware In 2001 DataPower s effort produced XML Generation Three XG3 the industry s fastest technology for XML processing bar none Today XG3 technology powers the industry s first wire speed XML network devices enabling secure high speed applications and XML Web Services While other companies are just now marketing first versions of products DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry leading customers and partners DataPower s M I T heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries drawing veteran leaders from several

Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital have joined DataPower s Board of Directors DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development marketing and sales of the company s breakthrough technology for XML Aware networking Founded in 1999 DataPower invented the world s first intelligent XML networking devices capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions at the wire speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services and other XML centric initiatives DataPower s solutions are based on its patent pending XML Generation Three XG3 technology Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter and intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type DataPower s XML acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of XML that is required to support next generation enterprise applications said Eugene Kuznetsov CTO and founder of DataPower Technology DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that s critical to Web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance A single DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment In addition the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security protection against XML based denial of service attacks connection of e business protocols for incompatible XML data streams load balancing between back end servers and real time statistics reports In the post bubble economy technology investment decisions require laser focused scrutiny DataPower s patent pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises said Michael Tyrrell of Venrock Associates By turbo charging their networks with DataPower s unique XML Aware networking technology companies will be free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and security said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital DataPower is on their third generation of technology Their patent pending XML Generation Three XG3 technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date XML is not a nice to have it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency Since 1999 DataPower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web services said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners DataPower s XML acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely on XML for mission critical applications About

I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message I first get a button that reads Check the signature with GnuPG If I punch the button and I dont have the signature on my keyring then I get a message saying just that and the message Can t check signature public key not found along with a button with the inscription Query keyserver If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs Forever If instead of punching the button I go out to the keyserver myself and then try the message again everything works so it SEEMS that it must be the code that goes out to the keyserver Anyone else with this problem This is EXMH v2 5 and tcl tk 8 4a4 Reg Clemens reg dwf com _______________________________________________ Exmh users mailing list Exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users ,100,173,hamnspam\ham

URL http diveintomark org archives 2002 10 04 html history_of_the_tilde Date 2002 10 04T00 27 41 05 00 So I was researching the history of the tilde because D told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a tilde in it Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time Which to be honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work But never mind that I don t want to talk about corporate politics I want to talk about the tilde Every command line loving geek will tell you that stands for 8220 home directory 8221 and cd will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone else s except on Mac OS X where it will take you to their Public file sharing directory It is from this heritage that we can trace the present day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal pages since one single system wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory Or more commonly now that Apache has taken over the world in their public_html subdirectory except on Mac OS X where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http localhost username you re actually being served files from that user s Sites directory within their home directory But I don t want to talk about Mac OS X I want to talk about the tilde As with so many other things I find that Jukka Korpela 1 is the expert in this field Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass 2 a word which Google old habits die hard 3 feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene Wallingford which like Jukka s home page can not be referenced without a tilde In fact Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in URLs 4 a treatise which I feel obliged to point out contains a tilde in its URL Clearly the tilde is underappreciated Digging further we find this post of Jukka s from 1998 5 in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd character called the overline Presumably to balance out the underline if indeed those sorts of things require balance There is balance in the universe to be sure but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard No matter The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish typing types could type the ntilde now referenced in HTML as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along the line it morphed into a general purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses Digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 6 then an alternate for and its life as an overline replacement came even later Jukka confirms this 7 and adds a timeline 1963 for 1964 for 1966 for overline Then June 30 1966 the watershed moment in an X3 committee meeting when it was proposed 8220 as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease SHARE 8221 I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means or what this committee meeting was about The next reference isn t until 1991 when the tilde was officially added to ISO 646 8 And now down the rabbit hole we go Scouring Usenet which the kids of yesterday called 8220 Deja News 8221 and kids today call 8220 Google Groups 8221 we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire yes _that_ William Safire article On Language 9 in which we learn that is officially pronounced 8220 squiggle 8221 This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary 10 to this very day I m not sure this is useful but I just thought it was cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ASCII characters As early as August 1990 tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem 11 In July 1989 Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde 12 In February 1988 an editor s note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde 13 As early as January 1987 less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF 14 As early as July 1986 troff supported the tilde 15 In November 1985 a mod sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements history tilde job control 16 As early as January 1984 tilde was included on the DEC keyboard 17 and listed in the APL 11 character set 18 In April 1983 tilde was causing bugs in vi 19 actually due to underlying bugs in csh In December 1982 is officially pronounced 8220 tilde 8221 20 prompting this typographical pun 21 And that s the earliest reference I can find So where does that leave us Unsatisfied no doubt There is history here but there are gaps What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966 How did the tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s When did it become a synonym for 8220 home directory 8221 When did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites I don t know and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research a failing for which I apologize profusely Goodnight goodnight May you dream of tildes stars and whorls 1 http www cs tut fi jkorpela 2 http www cs uni edu

The Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia That s a steppe too far Filed 28 08 2002 So you think you ve got it bad fed up with Folkestone bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield Those 54 per cent of Britons according to a Daily Telegraph YouGov survey this week who dream of a stress free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad Kommersant a Russian daily newspaper yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair s Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons its tongue in cheek article admitted however that the grass was not always greener on the other side The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet said Kommersant In any central Russian district life by British standards is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back By 11am most of the working population are becoming traditionally relaxed The time for elevenses in Britain perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow It is also opening time in the nation s vodka shops And the vodka like all other spirits is cheap Kommersant pointed out that the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling The whisky is cheap however because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before It is made of samagon home distilled moonshine vodka coloured with tea and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics While alcohol is plentiful and cheap food may not be so easy to come by The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs it selected oxtail soup as an example were in short supply However the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty For a modest reward in most Russian villages the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm s herd of cattle One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border However Kommersant pointed out language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live France the Russian paper claimed was a country where English is only known by the beggars Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists Despite the low cost of living and the easy going lifestyle the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons Even in the most temperate regions winter temperatures of 20C are common And somewhere like the Sakha Republic east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below 70C Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible Again the Russian paper had a word of reassurance While acknowledging the climatic problems it said that thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia Thirty three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave We think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians however not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home Yahoo Groups Sponsor 4 DVDs Free s p Join Now http us click yahoo com pt6YBB NXiEAA MVfIAA 7gSolB TM To unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe egroups com Your use of Yahoo Groups is subject to http docs yahoo com info terms ,409,752,hamnspam\ham
 Begin forwarded message From Ian Andrew Bell hello ianbell com Date Wed Oct 9 2002 11 16 09 PM US Pacific To mike michaelmoore com Cc foib ianbell com Subject POLITICOS Re Bowling for Columbine Opens This Friday Michael Why is it that people who consider voting in an election an inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message Don t get me wrong I think this is the case People will go to see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to express their malice and discontent towards not only the present regime in America but also the corrupt empty shallow pantomime which cast them into power In reality today the voting that takes place via the act of consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth and dimpling the appropriate chad or some other such convoluted act of free democratic expression Why Because in America they believe in dollars Dollars don t lie In practise they are the last frontier of truth in America universally accepted as expressions of fear desire passion and need Compared to the swing of the almighty buck and Jeb Bush knows this a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning Given that fact I modestly propose an entirely new though wholly logical extension to the current democratic system in place in America I propose we augment and effectively replace the electoral system with a political stock market We should accept that Politicians are entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in America and embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects their intent A politician should issue a constant number of shares dependent upon his tenure in government Those shares should be traded on an open exchange say the G R E E D short of course for the Global Realists Electoral Exchange Democratic Politicians we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their ability to maintain office grows As the truth about their embezzling campaign funds for weekend trips to Maui with their interns is revealed of course their fortunes will fall This represents an opportunity for the market forces those same forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal protest to voice their opinion on the quality of America s governance during the intervening four years between elections Elections themselves will in effect become meaningless as they are now since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each and every congressman senator and presidential candidate Just think of the coverage that could be given on MSNBC Strom Thurman STROM news quotes was down 15 today on fears that his latest heart operation will render him unable to attend Senate Armed Services committee meetings until November This would provide rejuvenating content to the econo political news sector which has found post economic bubble coverage to be both tiresome and deoressing The establishment of this new stock exchange would of course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained IT systems engineers who could after passing the electoral securities exam become floor traders This would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their multi billion dollar campaigns The requirement for the support of legions of spin doctors permanent campaign managers and investor relations personnel would also create jobs perhaps even a new practice for Ernst Young Arthur Anderson et al Insider trading scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch Martha Stewart as an unwitting beneficiary thus spreading her influence to politics Dividends if there are any on record at the close of a politician s career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings Pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the Beltway set Union funds brokerages and even pump and dump houses could benefit from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the Southeast and the Bush Governmet would be allowed to place Social Security bets where they really mattered investors who lose their retirement life savings and support could rest assured that they were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors Although there s no way to protect any of these for Worldcom like crashes ambitious inspired District Attorneys could file criminal suits against Candidates and Campaign Managers who underperform expectations thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty instead they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves On the whole I believe the system could work I could certainly work as well as our beloved securities trading industry and given the American electoral system s success at effectively expressing the will of the people it certainly couldn t do any worse In the meantime Mike I think I ll go see your movie and try to depose the President Ian On Wednesday October 9 2002 at 03 53 PM Michael Moore s Mailing List wrote October 9 2002 My Film Bowling for Columbine Opens This Friday Dear friends fans and fellow evildoers I am very happy and excited to tell you that this Friday October 11 my new film Bowling for Columbine will open in New York and Los Angeles It is I promise the last thing the Bushies want projected on the movie screens across America this week The film is first and foremost a devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for profit and power and no one in all the advance screenings I have attended has left the theatre with anything short of rage I truly believe this film has the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do something This is not good news for Junior and Company Not when they are trying to drag us into another war Not when a crazed sniper is exercising his constitutional right to own a high powered rifle Not when John Ashcroft is still prohibiting the FBI from looking through the gun background check files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased any weapons prior to 9 11 because THAT we are told would violate these terrorists sacred Second Amendment rights Yes I believe this movie can create a lot of havoc but I will need ALL of you to help me do this Are you game Last February 5th I wrote to tell you about a book I had written and how the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to publish anything critical of Bush after 9 11 I appealed to you to save Stupid White Men from the shredder and to go out and buy it I promised you would not regret it and that the book would not only be a great read but an important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of George W Bush Within 24 hours the book went to 1 on the Amazon best seller list By the fifth day the book was already into its 9th printing The publisher was torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money Greed won out and this Sunday the book enters its 31st week on the New York Times best seller list and its 32nd printing This is all because of you my crazy and loyal friends You made this happen against all the odds Now I would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work Bowling for Columbine It s a movie that many critics have already called my best film to date They may be right It is certainly the most provocative thing I have ever done I have spent three years on it and I have to say it cuts deeper harder and funnier that anything I have given you so far The movie opens this Friday in New York and Los Angeles and then in 8 more cities next week How it does in these first ten cities will determine whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it That is the nutty way our films are released If it doesn t have a big opening weekend you can kiss the film good bye Therefore this weekend this film must be seen by millions of Americans Can you help me make that happen Bowling for Columbine is not a film simply about guns or school shootings That is only the starting point for my 2 hour journey into the dark soul of a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of violence both at home and around the world With this movie I have broadened my canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st century a nation that seems hell bent on killing first and asking questions later It is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and terrorism against our own poor and how we have created a culture of fear that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore And it s a devastating comedy This film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts No film has EVER said the things I am saying in Bowling for Columbine I expect to be attacked I expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of retribution I expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many to swallow This is why I need your help Movies live or die based on what happens at the box office the first weekend of its release I need you if you live in the New York or L A area to go see Bowling for Columbine this Friday and Saturday and take as many family members and friends with you as possible I guarantee you will not be disappointed and you may just see one of the best films of the year Monday night in Times Square Bowling for Columbine had its premiere The crowd was amazing as it was this past Saturday night at the Chicago Film Festival The audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line The hate mail the threats the promises of retribution have already started to roll in to the distributor of this movie United Artists They are not backing down But how long will this last I need all of you in the New York tri state and southern California areas to go see Bowling for Columbine THIS weekend the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when it comes to your town A strong opening not only means that the rest of America will see this film it means that a good number of people who see it are going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved If it does poorly I will have a difficult time finding the funding for the movie I want to make next a film about 9 11 and how Bush is using that tragic day as a cover for his right wing agenda Don t let that happen Don t let the NRA have one more success by stopping the wider distribution of this movie And together let us not remain silent in our opposition to Bush s phony war against Iraq If you live in New York you can see it at the Lincoln Plaza the Sunshine and the Loews 19th St In L A you can catch it at the Sunset 5 the Westwood Regent Laemmle Sunset Laemmle Towncenter Encino Landmark Rialto Pasadena and Regal University Irvine Also please forward this to your other friends and tell them to go see Bowling for Columbine this weekend And finally don t miss our new website www bowlingforcolumbine com Thank you for your help with this I feel so honored and privileged to have so many people interested in my work Last January I was getting 70 000 hits a month on my website Last month I got 17 million hits This alone speaks volumes about the vast majority all of us belong to who are sick and tired of what is going on and are longing for an alternative

you with invaluable BR marketing information that includes How to send bulk e mails BR legally Where to find thousand of free classified ads and BR much much more BR BR There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going BR BR METHOD 1 SENDING BULK E MAIL LEGALLY BR BR Let s say that you decide to start small just to see how BR it goes and we ll assume you and those involved send out BR only 5 000 emails each Let s also assume that the mailing BR receives only a 0 2 response the response could be much BR better but lets just say it is only 0 2 Also many people BR will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of BR only 5 000 each BR BR Continuing with this example you send out only 5 000 e mails BR With a 0 2 response that is only 10 orders for Report 1 BR Those 10 people resonded by sending out 5 000 e mails each BR for a total of 50 000 Out of those 50 000 e mails only 0 2 BR responded with orders That s 100 people responded and BR ordered Report 2 Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e mails BR each for a total of 500 000 e mails The 0 2 response to BR that is 1000 orders for Report 3 BR BR Thoe 1000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of BR 5 million e mails sent out The 0 2 response to that is BR 10 000 orders for Report 4 Those 10 000 people send out BR 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 000 50 million BR e mails the 0 2 response to that is 100 000 orders for BR Report 5 BR BR THAT S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH 500 000 BR a half a million BR BR Your total income in this example is BR 1 50 BR 2 500 BR 3 5 000 BR 4 50 000 BR 5 500 000 Grand Total 555 550 00 BR BR NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL PAPER AND BR FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND BR NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL BR STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BR BR REMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 BR PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED BR BR Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone BR or 1 2 or even 1 5 of those people mailed 100 000 e mails BR each or more There are over 250 million people on the BR Internet worldwide and counting Believe me many people BR will do just that and more BR BR METHOD 2 PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET BR BR BR Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there BR are hundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of BR free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response BR We strongly suggest you start with method 1 and add METHOD BR 2 as you go along BR BR For every 5 you receive all you must do is e mail them the BR Report they ordered That s it Always provide same day BR service on all orders This will guarantee that the e mails BR they send out with your name and address on it will be BR prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the BR report BR

NOW BR BR MORE TESTIMONIALS BR BR My name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago BR I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I make BR pretty good money When I received this program I grumbled BR to Jody about receiving junk mail I made fun of the BR whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and BR percentages involved I knew it wouldn t work Jody BR totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later BR she jumped in with both feet I made merciless fun of her BR and was ready to lay the old I told you so on her when BR the thing didn t work Well the laugh was on me Within BR 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45 BR days she had received a total of 147 200 00 all cash BR I was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby BR BR Mitchell Wof Chicago Illinois BR BR BR Not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to BR make up my mind to participate in this plan But conservative BR that I am I decided that the initial investment was so little BR that there was just no way that I wouldn t get enough orders BR to at least get my money back I was surprised when I found BR my medium sized post office box crammed with orders I made BR 319 210 00 in the first 12 weeks The nice thing about this BR deal is that it does not matter where people live There BR simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and BR so big BR BR Dan Sondstrom Alberta Canada BR BR BR I had received this program before I deleted it but later BR I wondered if I should hav given it a try Of course I BR had no idea who to contact to get another copy so I had to BR wait until I was e mailed again by someone else BR 11 months passed then it luckily came again I did not BR delete this one I made more than 490 000 on my first try BR and all the money came within 22 weeks BR BR Susan De Suza New York NY BR BR BR It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy BR money with little cost to you I followed the simple BR instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started BR to come in My first month I made 20 560 00 and by the BR end of the third month my total cash count was 362 840 00 BR Life is beautiful thanks to the Internet

Dear Sir I am Dr James Alabi the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi nationals in the oil industry in favor of N N P C The original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of US 12 320 000 00 Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand United State Dollars This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned Consequently my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau civil service law from operating and or opening foreign accounts in our names Needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we have agreed to offer you 20 of the transferred sum while 10 shall be set aside for incidental expenses internal and external between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms Our assurance is that your role is risk free To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country I am averse to having my image and career dented This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable transaction I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100 risk free as we have done our homework properly I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential as we are still in government service which we intend to retire from in full honor Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year Thank you and God bless Dr James Alabi ,286,522,hamnspam\spam
HELLO By reading the short Summary just below you will see how you can learn new skills in communication do a direct marketing program on the internet and at the same time earn 100 000 or more to enable you to CHANGE YOUR LIFE SUMMARY Just read this Summary follow the actions that it advises and start earning some serious money You will learn new skills in communications and how to market on the internet What a Deal Your total cash investment is just 50 00 Step 1 If this is the first time you have seen this message and you have not joined in this program before then take out five US 10 00 bills total 50 investment and mail out 10 00 each to the following people to purchase five Guides on communications For each Guide that you will be ordering and buying write out on a sheet of plain white paper your own name address and YOUR OWN EMAIL ADDRESS and the number and name of the Guide that you are buying Then fold the paper put the 10 00 bill inside the sheet of paper insert the paper and 10 00 bill into an envelope address the envelope with the name and address of the person whose name is shown under each Guide below and mail the envelope by first class or air mail Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the envelopes No need to send by registered mail LIST OF FIVE NAMES ________________________________________________ GUIDE 1 How to be A More Effective Public Speaker Order Guide 1 for US 10 00 CASH from In addition to Guide 1 you will receive a valuable marketing Guide A Million Bucks From the Internet free of charge Derrick Nguyen 9530 Whitmore St El Monte CA 91733 USA ________________________________________________ GUIDE 2 How to Give a Business Presentation Order Guide 2 for US 10 00 CASH from Tim Fai GPO Box 260 Macau via Hong Kong ________________________________________________ GUIDE 3 How to Write More Effectively Order Guide 3 for US 10 00 CASH from Luis Pastor Apartado 81 48080 Bilbao Spain ________________________________________________ GUIDE 4 What to do at a Social Function Order Guide 4 for US 10 00 CASH from Chester Waldvogel 11 Chestnut Way Berlin MD 21811 USA ________________________________________________ GUIDE 5 How To Sharpen Your Mind Order Guide 5 for US 10 00 CASH from J Siden Krondikesvagen 54 A 83147 Ostersund Sweden ________________________________________________ END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES Step 2 These Guides will be emailed to you Save these Guides on your computer s hard disk as other people will be ordering these Guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers Step 3 From the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under GUIDE 5 and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE 4 s slot Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown Check the address again Step 4 Delete name and address under GUIDE 4 and replace with the name and address from GUIDE 3 s slot Step 5 Delete name and address under GUIDE 3 and replace with the name and address from GUIDE 2 s slot Step 6 Delete name and address under GUIDE 2 and replace with the name and address from GUIDE 1 s slot Step 7 Delete name and address under GUIDE 1 and replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS This step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the Guides Eventually your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached GUIDE 5 and then be dropped from the list The key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes Step 8 Once you have completed this new list send out this new email which shows your name under GUIDE 1 to as many email addresses as possible as many as 100 000 emails or even more The greater the number of mailings you make potentially the greater the number of people who will order the GUIDE 1 from you These people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under GUIDE 2 and so on This is all you need to do If you wish to read the rest of this email message then do so If not just do the 8 steps shown above Remember the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step 8 and to encourage and help those who purchase the Guides from you to send out emails of their own Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed Because if you do it will not work for you Your immediate reaction might be Why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends That might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people But that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit What will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers If the people you slip into that list aren t going to be sending new emails you re only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted There wouldn t be new buyers coming in So your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero Furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason Don t do it to others Remember honesty reaps the reward You may have a concern that after sending the total 50 to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the Guide Well rest assured As we said above it s to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers So don t think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for 10 00 The people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you Later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the Guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer Don t cheat Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit END OF SUMMARY REST OF MESSAGE With easy to use email tools and opt in email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before And the earnings potential is staggering READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END follow what it says and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for Yes I know what you are thinking I never responded to one of these before either One day though something made me feel You use 50 going to a movie for 2 hours with your spouse friend or child plus a simple meat at a restaurant Why the heck not No matter where you believe those feelings came from I thank every day that feeling came over me I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not Read on It works And when you read the Guides You ll learn how to become a more effective communicator What can be better A way to improve your self image and confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover your investment and make some good money making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home If you work on this program you will learn a lot about direct marketing on the internet If you believe direct marketing via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done in the future then the experience you will gain here could be a real boost in your work career possibly even providing a new career for you PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE If you want to make serious money read this message until you understand it completely and feel confident to follow through on what it advises FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE Remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will NOT work This IS a legitimate BUSINESS You are offering a product for sale to a buyer Treat it as such and you can see money coming to you in a reasonable period of time depending on the collective efforts of yourself and the others on the list of five Take this entire email with the modified list of names and save it on your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES There are 2 methods to get this venture going METHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY Let s say that you start small to see how it goes and that you and those involved send out only 5 000 emails each Let s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 1 1 10 of 1 response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only 0 1 Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5 000 each Out of your 5 000 emails and a 0 1 response that is only 5 orders for Guide 1 Those 5 people who responded also send out 5 000 emails each for a total of 25 000 Out of those 25 000 emails only 0 1 responded with orders That s 25 people who responded and ordered Guide 2 Those 25 people mail out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 125 000 emails The 0 1 response to that is 125 orders for Guide 3 Those 125 people send 5 000 emails each for a total of 625 000 emails sent out The 0 1 response is 625 orders for Guide 4 Those 625 people send out 5 000 emails each for a total of 3 125 000 emails The 0 1 response to that is 3 125 orders for Guide 5 or 31 250 at 10 per Guide This may seem a small amount to you but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out See what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly If Response Rate is 0 1 income from Guides 1 5 is 50 250 1 250 6 250 31 250 39 050 as above If Response Rate is 0 15 income from Guides 1 5 is 75 560 4 220 31 640 237 300 273 795 If Response Rate is 0 2 income from Guides 1 5 is 100 1 000 10 000 100 000 1 000 000 1 111 100 Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 emails each or more From the example above you can see the power of leveraging that is how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day METHOD 2 PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are Many FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response We strongly suggest you start with Method 1 and add METHOD 2 as you go along For every 10 you receive all you must do is email the Guide the buyer ordered Always provide same day service The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address In return when others buy the Guides from you you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to their email addresses This will benefit you because your name would be further down the list and their new buyers will buy from you This is no different than customer service in the retail or the bricks and mortars business AVAILABLE GUIDES The reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong It is simply about time Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER NAME ONLY Always send a single 10 bill U S CURRENCY for each Guide Checks NOT accepted Make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper On one of those sheets of paper write the NUMBER the NAME of the Guide you are ordering YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address Be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL ________________________________________________ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE 1 within 2 weeks continue sending emails until you do Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE 2 If not continue advertising or sending emails until you do Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE 2 YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING and cash should continue coming in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails You can KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM You have just received information that can give you financial freedom to really change your life but I don t wish to kid you This requires A BIT OF EFFORT You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you have put your name and address in GUIDE 1 and moved others to 2 5 slots as instructed above One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them Remember the more you send out the more potential buyers you will reach IT IS UP TO YOU ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY Upon your purchase of any GUIDE 1 through

All our mailings are sent complying to the proposed H R 3113 Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Act of 2000 Please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions PARENTS OF 15 YEAR OLD FIND 71 000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET Does this headline look familiar Of course it does You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program USA And reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods New Zealand His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 year old sons closet Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash Five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles My first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the 41 year old woman There was over 71 000 dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet As it turns out the boy had been sending out via E mail a type of Report to E mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet Everyday after school for the past 2 months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom I just got the E mail one day and I figured what the heck I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out says the clever 15 year old The E mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one 5 dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down and finally to add your name to the top of the list The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 address list I get junk E mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues Within the first few days of sending out the E mail the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing 5 bills About a week later I rode my bike down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the post office counter I thought I was in trouble or something laughs He goes on I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all Over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the E mail The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the 5 bills for twenties fifties and hundreds I didn t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but I just rode to the next bank down the street laughs Surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid The reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all In fact it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws Title 18 Section 1302 and 1341 or Title 18 Section 3005 in the US code also in the code of federal regulations Volume 16 Sections 255 and 436 which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received Every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read Please send me report number XYX This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service A Report on how to for a five dollar fee This is the end of the media release If you would like to understand how the system works and get your 71 000 please continue reading What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net YOU CAN USE IT TOO just follow the simple instructions BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR Before you say Bull please read the following This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some megabucks with only 25 out of pocket cost DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER Note follow the directons below I had best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions In order for all of us to be successful many many emails must be sent so that the returns are many I have been extremely successful using the following company They send out the offers and all I do is accept money for reports then I send back to the people as soon as possible This is what one had to say Thanks to this profitable opportunity I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required To my astonishment I received total 610 470 00 in 21 weeks with money still coming in Pam Hedland Fort Lee New Jersey Here is another testimonial This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my 25 on it I followed the simple instructions and walaa 3 weeks later the money started to come in First month I only made 240 00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 290 000 00 So far in the past 8 months by re entering the program I have made over 710 000 00 and I am playing it again The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything More testimonials later but first PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE Order all 5 reports shown on the list below For each report send 5 CASH THE NAME NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems When you place your order make sure you order each of the 5 reports You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer Within a few days you will receive vie e mail each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000 s of people who will order them from you Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer IMPORTANT DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step 1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits Once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it Remember this method has been tested and if you alter it will NOT work People have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money But it does not work this way Believe us we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed Because if you do it will not work for you Remember honesty reaps the reward 1 After you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement and REMOVE the name address of the person in REPORT 5 This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune 2 Move the name address in REPORT 4 down TO REPORT 5 3 Move the name address in REPORT 3 down TO REPORT 4 4 Move the name address in REPORT 2 down TO REPORT 3 5 Move the name address in REPORT 1 down TO REPORT 2 6 Insert YOUR name address in the REPORT 1 Position PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name address ACCURATELY Take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data To assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going METHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK E MAIL LEGALLY Let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5 000e mails each Let s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 2 response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 2 Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only 5 000 each Continuing with this example you send out only 5 000 e mails With a 0 2 response that is only 10 orders for report 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e mail each for a total of 50 000 Out of those 50 000 e mails only 0 2 responded with orders That equals 100 people responded and ordered Report 2 Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 500 000 e mails The 0 2 response to that is 1000 orders for Report 3 Those 1000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 5 million e mails sent out The 0 2 response to that is 10 000 orders for Report 4 Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 000 50 million e mails The 0 2 response to that is 100 000 orders for Report 5 THAT S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH 500 000 00 half million Your total income in this example is 1 50 2 500 3 5 000 4 50 000 5 500 000 Grand Total 555 550 00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000e mails each or more There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting Believe me many people will do just that and more METHOD 2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response We strongly suggest you start with Method 1 and add METHOD 2 as you go along For every 5 you receive all you must do is e mail them the Report they ordered That s it Always provide same day service on all orders This will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER NAME ONLY Notes Always send 5 cash U S CURRENCY for each Report Checks NOT accepted Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil On one of those sheets of paper Write the NUMBER the NAME of the Report you are ordering YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW REPORT 1 The Insider s Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net Order Report 1 from R R PO Box 18048 Chicago IL 60618 __________________________________________________________ REPORT 2 The Insider s

Report 5 From L Samon PO BOX 31 Castletown Isle of Man IM 99 5XP YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report 1 within 2 weeks continue sending e mails until you do orders 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT 2 If you did not continue advertising or sending e mails until you do Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report 2 YOU CAN RELAX because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a Different report You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Do Not change it in any way It works exceedingly well as it is now Remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report 1 and moved others to 2 thru 5 as instructed above One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e mails and your name will be on every one of them Remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach So my friend I have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent IT IS UP TO YOU NOW MORE TESTIMONIALS My name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago I am an accountant with a major U S Corporation and I make pretty good money When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving junk mail I made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved I knew it wouldn t work Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old I told you so on her when the thing didn t work Well the laugh was on me Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45 days she had received total 147 200 00 all cash I was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby Mitchell Wolf Chicago Illinois Not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan But conservative that I am I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders I made 319 210 00 in the first 12 weeks The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live There simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big Dan Sondstrom Alberta Canada I had received this program before I deleted it but later I wondered if I should have given it a try Of course I had no idea who to contact to get another copy so I had to wait until I was e mailed again by someone else 11 months passed then it luckily came again I did not delete this one I made more than 490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks Susan De Suza New York N Y If you have any questions of the legality of

this If you aren t interested just simply delete it READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy weekly paycheck Make more in a few months than last year at work Believe it work it This really works don t make the same mistake I made I deleted this 4 5 times before finally giving it a try Within 2 weeks the orders money started coming in just like the plan below said it would Give it a try You will be glad you did Thanks and Good Luck You won t need luck just keep reading Don t delete this First read about how a 15 year old made 71 000 See below AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV This is the media report PARENTS OF 15 YEAR OLD FIND 71 000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET Does this headline look familiar Of course it does You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program USA And reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods New Zealand His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 year old sons closet Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash Five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labeled piles My first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the 41 year old woman There was over 71 000 dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet As it turns out the boy had been sending out via E mail a type of Report to E mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet Everyday after school for the past 2 months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom I just got the E mail one day and I figured what the heck I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out says the clever 15 year old The E mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one 5 dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 address list I get junk E mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues Within the first few days of sending out the E mail the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing 5 bills About a week later I rode my bike down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the post office counter I thought I was in trouble or something laughs He goes on I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all Over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the E mail The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the 5 bills for twenties fifties and hundreds I didn t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but I just rode to the next bank down the street laughs Surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid The reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all In fact it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws Title 18 Section 1302 and 1341 or Title 18 Section 3005 in the US code also in the code of federal regulations Volume 16 Sections 255 and 436 which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received Every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read Please send me report number XYX This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service

MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data To assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going METHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK E MAIL LEGALLY Let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5 000 e mails each Let s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 2 response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 2 Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e mails instead of only 5 000 each Continuing with this example you send out only 5 000 e mails With a 0 2 response that is only 10 orders for report 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e mail each for a total of 50 000 Out of those 50 000 e mails only 0 2 responded with orders That s 100 people responded and ordered Report 2 Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 500 000 e mails The 0 2 response to that is 1000 orders for Report 3 Those 1000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 5 million e mails sent out The 0 2 response to that is 10 000 orders for Report 4 Whose 10 000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 000 50 million e mails The 0 2 response to that is 100 000 orders for Report 5 THAT S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH 500 000 00 half million Your total income in this example is 1 50 2 500 3 5 000 4 50 000 5 500 000 Grand Total 555 550 00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000e mails each or more There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting Believe me many people will do just that and more METHOD 2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response We strongly suggest you start with Method 1and add METHOD 2 as you go along For every 5 you receive all you must do is e mail them the Report they ordered That s it Always provide same day service on all orders This will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report AVAILABLE REPORTS ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER NAME ONLY Notes Always send 5 cash U S CURRENCY for each Report Checks NOT accepted Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper On one of those sheets of paper Write the NUMBER the NAME of the Report you are ordering YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW REPORT 1 The Insider s Guide to

1 within 2 weeks continue sending e mails until you do After you have received 10 orders 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT 2 If you did not continue advertising or sending e mails until you do Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report 2 YOU CAN RELAX because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a Different report You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Do Not change it in any way It works exceedingly well as it is now Remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report 1 and moved others to 2 5 as instructed above One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e mails and your name will be on every one of them Remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach So my friend I have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent IT IS UP TO YOU NOW MORE TESTIMONIALS My name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago I am an accountant with a major U S Corporation and I make pretty good money When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving junk mail I made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved I knew it wouldn t work Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old I told you so on her when the thing didn t work Well the laugh was on me Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45 days she had received total 147 200 00 all cash I was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby Mitchell Wolf M D Chicago Illinois Not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan But conservative that I am I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders I made 319 210 00 in the first 12 weeks The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live There simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big Dan Sondstrom Alberta Canada I had received this program before I deleted it but later I wondered if I should have given it a try Of course I had no idea who to contact to get another copy so I had to wait until I was e mailed again by someone else 11 months passed then it luckily came again I did not delete this one I made more than 490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks Susan De Suza New York N Y It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in My first month I made 20 560 00 and by

our replies are in black type June 4 1999 Sirs The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti However the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations namely the DOM and sister nation the Kingdom of EnenKio the Marshallese name for Wake Island claiming to represent the mid Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France Presse The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation A Honolulu based attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed http www goldhaven com issue4 Two htm disconnected as of 2 1 00 The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio I am aghast at how distorted erroneous and misleading the article is As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction For your convenience your text will be set off with in color DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti Comment The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti in which case a reader may be misled Correction DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific However the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations Comment Just because the RMI government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of EnenKio does that make it true Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized and documented time and again for fraud abuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government namely the DOM and sister nation the Kingdom of EnenKio the Marshallese name for Wake Island Comment Nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak for DOM but as for the Kingdom we don t even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign His Majesty King Remios the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen Kio Atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism Doesn t anybody check sources anymore Correction The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM claiming to represent the mid Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France Presse Comment The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio who are forced to live in exile from Eneen Kio Atoll lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years Furthermore an article in Agence France Presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government My preceding comments apply The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an investment scam We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio but also will positively impact people around the globe In fact we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism Doesn t anybody check sources anymore The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation Comment The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no fraudulent claims of which I am aware and in my post I am responsible for all published information I would personally caution any countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of nations companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect However my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source Furthermore the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1 3 of the land in the Marshall Islands including recent attempts to sequester him against his will We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism A Honolulu based attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s Comment Mr Moore is not an Attorney though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s Correction The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen Kio Atoll a k a Enen kio Halcyon Disclerta Wake and 6 8 other names Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls he passed away in December 1998 and was fully recognized by the RMI government He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994 whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen Kio Atoll ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel sic Hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf Correction The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel s appointment of Mr Robert Moore the adopted brother of Hermios Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios and the people s behalf The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed Comment Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an agreement The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen Kio Atoll which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen Kio Atoll because the atoll by any name you choose was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979 nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act law mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen Kio and any statement to the contrary is false fraudulent and irresponsible Finally I suggest you as a journalist or publisher do a little more research not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio but into the prehistoric history and more recent U S invasion of Eneen Kio Atoll properly named by Marshallese centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above all of which exist in hard copy not in cyberspace and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show in many cases full color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world many of which are first world In closing I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and if corrected elsewhere that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE June 3 1999 Sir The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio thank you for spelling EnenKio correctly The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio Fantasy Island Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok December 10 1998 Determined not to give up Pedley moved his fictional nation once again this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific According to a Melchizedek press release posted on its home page Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of EnenKio another only in cyberspace country which in this case claims the U S held Wake Island In real life Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands http www feer com Restricted index_corrections html link to article of December 24 1998 Fantasy Island disconnected as of 2 1 00 Response to the author I am unable to locate the Melchizedek press release you cited indicating that Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of EnenKio Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands Further more Melchizedek DOM is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September 1997 but it did not convey a lease of land It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments However a prior agreement signed in May 1997 which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio transferred Mr Robert Moore s rights to develop Taongi from Mr Moore to DOM It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence This was made possible because Mr Moore is the Alab one class of landowner of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll from the principal landowner Iroijlaplap Paramount Chief Murjel Hermios who was aware of and supported the transaction Consideration if any under the agreement was personally retained by Mr Moore who is also the adopted brother of Hermios Now please understand that while Mr Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf and that of the future use and development of Taongi which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios Mr Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio Iroijlaplap Hermios also wore he died in December 10 1998 the same date of your article other hats one as First Monarch King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen Kio Atoll a k a Enen kio Halcyon Disclerta Wake and several other names For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is another only in cyberspace country as you did in the above article is not only a completely and categorically false statement but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio And it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen Kio Atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license unless of course your statement could be proved accurate I suggest you do a little more research not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio but into the prehistoric history and more recent U S invasion of Eneen Kio Atoll properly named by Marshallese centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files all of which exist in hard copy not cyberspace and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show in many cases full color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world many of which are first world In closing I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE June 2 1999 Sir The following statement in quotes was copied from one of your Footnotes to History D and E disconnected as of 12 1 00 Enenkio Atoll In 1898 the United States annexed Wake Island in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific After the Marshalls became a U S Trust Territory the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain and pressed their historical claims to the atoll called Enenkio locally The U S government has consistently ignored these claims The protests took a sharper turn after the U S Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai i King Murjel Hermios who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls declared Wake Island s independence in 1987 The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek Comment With all candor I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest unless your site is intended as some twisted joke which I am assuming is not the case in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio I am aghast at how distorted erroneous and misleading your summary is As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction For your convenience your text will be set off with in color In 1898 the United States annexed Wake Island in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific Correction In 1898 the United States invaded Wake Island the northernmost atoll actually named Eneen Kio centuries before western explorers arrived of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean The Author responds Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory After the Marshalls became a U S Trust Territory the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain and pressed their historical claims to the atoll called Enenkio locally Correction Following W W II the Trust Territories of the Pacific which included the Marshall Islands was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations While Eneen Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls the U S only knew it as Wake and having lost many U S lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders kept control of it In 1993 the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan s historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen Kio Atoll The Author responds I don t see much conflict between the two versions here The U S government has consistently ignored these claims Correction The U S government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979 and from the former traditional landowners including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios The Author responds I will note this The protests took a sharper turn after the U S Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai i Correction The Eneen Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U S Congress when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai i by a group of American businessmen and U S Marines and in the following year returned the island of Kaho olawe to the Hawaiian People King Murjel Hermios who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls declared Wake Island s independence in 1987 Correction King Murjel Hermios who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998 declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994 whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen Kio Atoll ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy The Author responds I will make the necessary corrections here The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek Correction After the death of the First Monarch his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother Crown Prince Lobadreo over the Kingdom of EnenKio today To continue the commentary The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets But that is another story which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter The Author responds I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore s Melchizedek project which can be located on the web through the Sources Bibliography section of my web page is non existent Be assured I will look further into par this Thank you again for your response Captain Rydell I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so June 7 1999 SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF

yokwe net mboard newsinfo thread cgi 67 0 cf0 discontinued as of 12 1 00 The author Mr Joseph Biglar Undersecretary is not known to us has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio nor with its Monarch His Majesty King Remios at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio There is no valid reason to assume that the said press release is indeed an official document The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio headed by His Majesty King Remios on the basis of his proper and lawful authority have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands Response to so called Press Release This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which has been confirmed by the U S State Department See Human Rights Report This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands or any acts decisions mandates announcements or directives thereby shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention 1933 was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios in 1987 was established by way of a public authority the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll ratified in 1994 by its people has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states including the Dominion of Melchizedek has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as now quoting Mr Biglar s statement RMI geographical and political boundaries exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law reinforced by the RMI Constitution upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands has not subjugated assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity including the Republic of the Marshall Islands Mr Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands also exists as a sovereign state defined by the Montevideo Convention 1933 was conceived as a separate state by UN foreign governments which included the United States China and the USSR was also established under a public authority the Constitution of the Marshall Islands ratified in 1979 by its people has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr Biglar has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen Kio Atoll which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979 nor subsequently incorporated by any act law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent as in the instant matter exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent as in the instant matter has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom His Majesty King Remios as Head of State the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures Furthermore in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands then you decide for yourself With this Constitution we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony subscribing to the principles of democracy sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal On behalf of His Majesty King Remios we administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to

Islands beloved husband and father was felt throughout the society Flags were flown at half mast for a week in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the world His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the highest ranking chiefs according to Marshallese custom His Majesty King Remios Hermios Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother Remios who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned His Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls His successor is designated to be his brother HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios For further information contact the State Secretary back on the home page SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE March 1999 Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Subject A State of War Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government The United States government admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in taking possession of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation these scars on Marshallese society have not healed Thus a current state of adversity exists Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island the government of EnenKio on behalf of the Marshallese King issued the State of War a Declaration and broadcast it to the world The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war not by virtue of being kept in but by virtue of being kept out It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief King Murjel Hermios In retrospect the Declaration has had little visible effect While a state of adversity does exist the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U S Congress to obey its own laws to conform to the UN Charter conventions of the United Nations relating to self determination preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses it believes accountability requires the U S to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity The refusal of the U S to meet its obligations even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties perpetuates the adversity turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U S pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members Your understanding is appreciated SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE December 19 1998 News Release Subject Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio His Majesty King Murjel Hermios Embassies missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half staff until 11 January 1999 Memorial services held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen Kio Atoll esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date In the interim a Reagent will serve as Head of State HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century were found to have a well developed societal structure Many nations have since mostly by force prevailed over the Marshall Islands imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States In one of the most courageous acts in recent times Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands seas and lagoon of Eneen Kio Atoll for his beloved people The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States may be researched at the official Internet site On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re establish Marshallese domination over Eneen Kio Atoll We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions In lieu of flowers mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call 808 373 9254 Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE July 14 1998 Communiqu to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against fraudulent claims We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated To that end you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns For your advice the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios to resolve the virtual state of war that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations The Kingdom does not pretend to be quoting from the report asserting authority over land within the geographical and political boundaries of the RMI We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re establish there As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge We say let the issue be played out in the People s venue for the record not in a libelous weekly publication While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves our raison d tre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to the Constitution of EnenKio which can be seen at our web site http www enenkio wakeisland org Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand of May 1st the editor was advised contrary to his report that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom s web site The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS If you have evidence to the contrary our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport that such an act is patently illegal The published statement The group claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain is wholly false I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries as the Ratak atolls surely are Contrary to their libelous statements the Kingdom of EnenKio was not created by Robert Moore and he is not a Honolulu based attorney HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom not of his own choice but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994 Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history Enenkio sic actually Enen kio or Eneen Kio in reference to the atoll itself is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok ak Taongi Atoll Wake is a fictitious moniker applied to the re discovered Eneen Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE May 4 1997 News Release Subject Issuance of Gold Stamps The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps This announcement made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp Coin and Postcard Show May 4th was the first pre publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997 First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official First Day of Issue by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release Distributors dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list BACKGROUND The Kingdom was established in March 1993 and the government was chosen by the people who then ratified the constitution in September 1994 However due to U S military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces the government of the Kingdom lingers in exile Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe South America USA and elsewhere A NATION IN CONFLICT The land in question commonly known as Wake Island is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them Wake Wilkes and Peale Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen Kio lived in the Marshall Islands exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site By way of developing the atoll as a nation the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to Wake atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy STATE OF WAR By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U S officials the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual state of war now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States Calls to end U S operations vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears Despite repeated notices letters and legal advertising all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government INAUGURAL ISSUE The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears For that reason the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency However the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world Note Stamps are printed on paper stock do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money CLOSING COMMENTS The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region In doing so it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE March 31 1997 News Release An official document entitled A Declaration was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States including selected Cabinet members The document asserts that A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures statements letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993 each with similar objectives Calls for the U S to cease operations vacate the premises negotiate return of the island to the King apologize and compensate him for use abuse and illegal hold over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government Likewise despite repeated notices letters and legal announcements major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy arrogance and human rights violations by the United States The land in question commonly called Wake Island is comprised of three small islands Wake Wilkes and Peale named by Western explorers for Western persons What of the native discoverers The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898 and again in1899 Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships en route to the Philippines on war missions and subsequent Congressional action were the sole basis of the U S claim The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East Such a station was never established at Wake Island It was destined to become a military installation However formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U S President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed But since the U S abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War the objections fell into oblivion It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued The U S did not establish a settlement there until under a lease in 1934 the CAA predecessor of the FAA allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans pacific seaplanes Clearly the so called annexation by the U S is grossly flawed the occupation patently illegal and its ownership is held therefore to be wholly invalid When the U S Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U S Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the natives of Hawaii a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island The islands of Eneen Kio as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more hospitable islands of the Marshall group While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho olawe was the use of the islands of Eneen Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy devoid of scrutiny oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries natives continued to use Eneen Kio authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap Paramount Chief King Murjel Hermios holds that title today By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island The U S cannot produce a title The Hermios ancestral lineage passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers who gave the atoll its Marshallese name their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio by virtue of the Declaration yields to the recognition that a State of War exists over the island nation This is not however to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom over all other claims is forthrightly reasserted The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U S ownership and occupation Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights In the Declaration demands are made as follows to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens to cease and desist effective immediately all and every action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone to pay that certain debt perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice No 97 US 03 dated March 10 1997 for which it is obligated to pay That the Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly Appeals are being made to the United Nations News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE February 6 1995 News Release On behalf of His Majesty King Murjel Hermios Monarch of EnenKio Atoll titular head of State Paramount Chief Iroijlaplap of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting Yokwe The purpose of this notice is twofold First to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known then failed to take action Second to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue As long as you remain quiet safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent your anonymity and that of your publication is well served Summary of Events 1993 94 Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean EnenKio formerly known as Wake Island The first was issued on February 25 1994 It followed two announcements 1 officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB Hawaii said in articles published New Year s Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October 1994 2 US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island part of the star wars program I am led to believe An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence thus seeking self rule under the natural landowner as king Letters to Mr Clinton members of Congress U S Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio Wake I Peale I Wilkes I denounced the Army s so called no significant impact scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds and asserted rightful ownership claims On March 21 1994 a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios who had granted special power of attorney to Mr Robert Moore appointed Minister Plenipotentiary The Constitution Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted On September 30th a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens believing as did the USA founding fathers that such power was an inherent right of the people It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation it acknowledged His Majesty King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions Formal documents of recognition were presented offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations UN Security Council NATO South Pacific Commission and others Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council On October 10th a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17 1899 seizure under force of arms of the islands of Eneen Kio Atoll the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands Public Law 99 239 January 14 1986 Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time the U S is now in default under commercial law owing in excess of US 100 million The second official press release was issued on November 21 1994 relating the preceding events Of all the agencies to whom it was sent only two the Marshall Islands Journal a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story then only briefly Request for Media Response The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity to before the birth of Jesus worth a little journalistic investigation How about suspicions of insidious military sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of world leadership Or is it world domination People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you the media in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage 1 Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U S expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen Kio Atoll then being utilized by sailors hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco Note These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record not a fabrication 2 Investigate and or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U S policy past and present or the lack thereof with regard to the role of EnenKio Note It is my understanding Wake was decommissioned after the so called processing of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s 3 Reflect on the contrasting history of U S occupation war technological advances in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind 4 Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king s claim of allodial title the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner 5 Bring to light U S strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation offensive defensive weapon systems clandestine military research environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there Note Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects 6 Fully disclose to the people of the United States U S strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions disregard for Human rights protected under international law United Nations Charter and conventions and the U S Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century Note U S apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island Kaho olawe also of religious significance has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens Parting Shot What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general the U S federal government more precisely which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe but considering its present source it is downright alarming It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years letters reports forms published articles press releases legal notices documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U S federal government Our not too distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of manifest destiny which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago If this current trend signifies a resurgence it can only be considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record of American attempts at fixing up the world The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen Kio Atoll pre dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor People have a right to know the media a responsibility to show them In conclusion I reiterate that our focus from my point of view is one not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U S political philosophy and military prowess but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God given individual rights Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry TOP OF PAGE November 21 1994 News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island site of a U S military outpost His Majesty King Murjel Hermios through his legal representative Minister Plenipotentiary Robert Moore the U S has been given the boot out of Wake Island Moore served legal notice on top U S government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands The filing came on the heels of a five year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands owned by predecessors of King Hermios by the gun boat USS Bennington in 1899 The legal document a Commercial Affidavit Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes It details the specifics of King Hermios ancestral rights to Wake Island the illegality of the U S claim and violations of native laws International Agreements and human rights during their 95 year hold on the Hermios property It also establishes default recognized under law by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged Under those claims demand was made for payment of 94 7 million dollars for past use of the land Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995 While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights U S officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile Eneen Kio Atoll a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange kio flower found there is made up of 3 islands including Wake Predecessors in interest of King Hermios aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand the islanders themselves A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians who recently gained an apology from the U S Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U S government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief Iroijlaplap of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands which terminates to the north beyond Eneen Kio Atoll Mr Moore has full authority to act on the King s behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King s assertion of his native allodial rights Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U S Air Force command 15th Logistics Group Hickam AFB Hawaii Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31 1993 and January 1 1994 headlined Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island and stated Not much activity there anymore so the Air Force wants to give up control According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios his predecessors and people Mr Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government to initiate and administer to its citizens promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council Since 1987 despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke Mr Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States military officers and members of Congress The following is a summary of some of the recent letters inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner King Murjel Hermios Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in February 1993 requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored As a military base Wake Airfield was decommissioned more than a decade ago In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U S Army officials who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands went unanswered Letters to members of the U S Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered A Resolution dated March 21 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios It was likewise ignored After waiting for more than 580 days since formal notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States Mr Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council They along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen Kio formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30 1994 They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen Kio Atoll which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan the Emperor of Germany and the King of Spain they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth Honor and Peace Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States Those tenets were likewise embodied affirmed and ratified by the U S Congress in Public Law 99 239 Jan 14 1986 signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese natural rights including those of ownership and use of land Still mindful of the terrible threat of

It was the Spring of 1979 I was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles Each day in the cafeteria I walked from table to table Stealing other kids lunch money No I didn t rob them with a gun or a knife I just made them a little deal Let me borrow two dollars today I said and I ll bring you five dollars next week The investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes Of course when next week rolled around and I couldn t pony up the cash I promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer Eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year s lunch money I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and I didn t even get beat up Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn First of all greed is your number one enemy You re not going to turn 2 into 5 in a week so cash out when you re ahead Don t wait for the boat to

you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it Where would you travel What kind of car would you buy The fact is youth is the best time to be rich If your goal is to make quick profits in the market volatility is your ally and stability your enemy You want to see those large upswings two hundred points in a day followed by the four hundred point crash a week later You don t care if the market went up or down 20 this year as long it was UNSTABLE That s how you re going to make the money What I m talking about here is day trading My father invests the traditional way he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K In the long term of 5 10 years he makes money The day trader buys or sells 5 000 shares of XYZ for a 25 000 profit in a 5 10 minute trade He acts quickly taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours sometimes within minutes I can teach you how to do this and how to make amazing amounts of money at it It s not rocket science and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training The truth is wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring They don t want the competetion and they sure as hell don t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they d charge you forty or fifty dollars They make their money only if you believe two lies 1 That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person 2 That using an investment adviser

bank The only way to get rich quick or otherwise is through hard work knowledge and determination After learning the fundamentals of day trading I started practicing the trading art itself and the first few weeks brought modest gains The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living and I was pulling close to a six figure income In less than three years with no formal financial training minimal effort and only moderate risk I had made my first million The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book the Master Trader You will learn from my mistakes and from my successes as I teach you the simple secret formula for day trading that I ve used profitably year after year The income of the day

It was the Spring of 1979 I was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles Each day in the cafeteria I walked from table to table Stealing other kids lunch money No I didn t rob them with a gun or a knife I just made them a little deal Let me borrow two dollars today I said and I ll bring you five dollars next week The investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes Of course when next week rolled around and I couldn t pony up the cash I promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer Eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year s lunch money I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and I didn t even get beat up Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn First of all greed is your number one enemy You re not going to turn 2 into 5 in a week so cash out when you re ahead Don t wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket Second never trust an investment adviser of any kind They are looking out for their own money not yours The professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW According to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money you re going to make Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is NEVER In a sense they are right If you put 250 000 in an index fund right now you ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years But here s the problem Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich Hell no You want the money NOW so you can enjoy it It s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair If

 ilug From Mr Michael Kamah and Family Johannesburg South Africa My Dear Good day This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires I got your contact information from your country s information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes My name is Mr Michael Kamah the second son of Mr Smith Kamah of Beitbridge Zimbabwe At the height of the present political crises in our country in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president Mr Robert G Mugabe in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february 2002 in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house My father during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr Robert Mugabe and his followers which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts That not being enough the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes that included my fathers assets and accounts who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers along with the assets of these white farmers themselves that are being presently confiscated I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood During my fathers life on earth he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars 8 600 000 00 in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father and with the present clamp down killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe s regime My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit Now this is what I actually want you to do for me 1 I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office 2 To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years Please I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request Best Regards Mr Michael Kamah and family Irish Linux Users Group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information List maintainer listmaster linux ie ,343,751,hamnspam\spam

 Welcome to Ghetto America Yes you heard me I said Ghetto America What is Ghetto America I m glad you asked Before I go on please be warned this explanation may not sit well with many of you however it is no less true Ghetto America is a society of individuals comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the impoverished and often unpolished side of Black America Confused I shall explain further have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community namely the projects and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood and wondered how could that be Or maybe you have been to a shopping mall and noticed an unusual amount of young teen looking black women carrying infants or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow Perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important wedding band missing from their respective ring fingers And of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns and knives allegedly mugging robbing and carjacking people of all sorts Did you know that many young African American women refuse to date African American males if they do not own or possess an automobile In fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society commonly known as Thugs or Street Hustlers Also did you know that many young African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the projects rather than move away purchase new homes save or even make investments Attention This is Not another Boyz in the Hood Story These newly distinguished Black Generation Xers are suffering through utter chaos Baby Makers Loser choosers Welfare Abusers Images of My America is a collection of observations and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African American Male who experienced and perpetuated many of the truths that many in Black America and the world in general would have you believe do not exist It is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive and often discriminatory nature of Mainstream American Society A society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self respect and enlightenment that many young African American men and women currently suffer from The writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children with many being teens themselves and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male s tough or cool neighborhood reputation The author also identifies the self destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like refusing to pursue higher education carrying guns robbing stealing selling drugs driving fancy cars and wearing expensive jewelry The negative and self debasing behavior committed by both males and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes These poor choices and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty and lack of direction that currently exists in young Black America today To learn more about this dynamic self contained society visit www BlackRealityPublishing com and reserve your copy today To request an excerpt please email Books BlackRealityPublishing com Buy this soon to be Best Seller now www BlackRealityPublishing com ,350,615,hamnspam\spam

 Foreword After thirty three years of being a black man living in Ghetto America an environment notorious for danger crime and poverty I have made startling discoveries involving young African American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the Black Generation X I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African Americans from the general definition of Generation X Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed Baby Boomers it s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African American culture I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life Taken from a web site entitled Generation X created and maintained by the Colorado College the definition is as follows We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981 We are individuals who live for the here and now like to experiment and who require immediate results We are typically selfish and cynical and depend a lot on our parents We question authority and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations It s that simple It seems we have come to be called Xer s simply because we represent something negative to our elders We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings Of course they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility or actually their fault Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school It appears we have little hope for the future No jobs no homes and basically no money are almost expected of us These bleak prospects along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever do not provide much hope Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood as our saviors We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens It over generalizes the similarities it expresses and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years When in fact these similarities speak primarily to only white issues and concerns For instance they say we depend a lot on our parents but in ghetto America we could only depend on one our mothers They also say we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations and we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever In ghetto America no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now and is all we have time for I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer s black and white occupants would eventually be identified I never knew I would be the one doing it Extracting the Black from Generation X and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency Without doing so the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today White America charges that we spend our time collecting welfare refusing to vote reading elementary styled books watching music videos day dreaming of becoming rappers basketball players selling drugs and making babies Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs s documentary entitled Ethnic Notions When African Americans are mentioned whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book A reality that I confirmed while watching Roger Me another documentary written and directed by Michael Moore Sadly many of us have begun to validate this skewed image while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B E T Black Entertainment Television Many of us fail to realize that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal should be taken as an opportunity to improve empower enlighten and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior Regarding Black Women I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole that black men owed them something and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives be it emotional physical or economical Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended In most cases it has not been It s funny though looking back I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to or the various schools of thought they possessed Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African American male some fair and some unfair Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African American perspective These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African Americans thrive on a middle to upper class professional level They relay stories of relationship problems with Huxtable like bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love As I read these stories I couldn t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or working class African Americans Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the Huxtable like dynamic unfortunately they are few and far between The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our dirty laundry The fact is truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal As our discussion intensified I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed and oftentimes not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self destructive thinking and self imprisoning behavior that black male and female generation X have been subscribing to While discussing this with my friend she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I m attempting to convey Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative to grab a dictionary Don t feel bad there were several times I had to as well Regarding Black Men An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool buying sports wear driving expensive cars wearing gold or platinum jewelry and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African American culture because I have lived it I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level It is a world of ignorance selfishness pre occupation and idiocy In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education who brag about having served time in U S penitentiaries the types of guns they carry dope peddling and chasing women They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit In this world wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they ve got a million It s a world where children dress in over priced sports wear mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye Thinking such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one s self worth and the possible corruption this thinking breeds seems to not be an important concern for black mothers It may come as a shock to know that most African Americans feel that those who don t have the same if not better material possessions are lesser beings referring to them as being corny lame or broke Even our male rapper entertainers promote backward priorities nothing else matters as long as you look good The Big Tymers a popular rap duo have a song called I m Still Fly shown in heavy rotation on B E T and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country Fly is ghetto vernacular for well dressed also used to describe a female s beauty Its signature verse asserts I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci Suit can t pay my rent cause all my money s spent but that s O K cause I m still fly Worse yet in the song Grinding the popular duo Eclipse glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video The term grinding is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B E T is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil Some of the key lyrics to this song are grinding you know what I keep in the lining the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs and Patty cake Patty cake I m the bakers man I bake them cakes as fast as I can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup In this verse the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake hence the term cake or sometimes pie Unfortunately for the rap genre this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law The negative references I ve identified have become an integral part of the urban African American existence This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has There is an overwhelming part of the African American community that is aware of this crippling mentality There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately more that do not even care Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily Whether because of habit or misguided values this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us We must save ourselves I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now and are thinking what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far as well as those I have al luded too I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth whether good or bad I am aware that not all of us have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified Additionally throughout this book I will refer to African Americans in four different ways the first being African Americans denoting our status as citizens in the United States secondly as Black a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country third as Niggas a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with Nigger The term nigga has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship hence the term My Nigga as well as a blanket reference when speaking to of or about other black males in a non personal manner I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place and fourth as Ghetto this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the less polished members of our community It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such My commentary is based on real life situations both good and bad and how one African American man was affected by them To that end I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered Despite the negativity they have displayed I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to in many ways has caused them to become their own worst enemy In the case of the black female s negative and limited perspective toward black men the world and subconsciously themselves I submit that this mentality is perhaps single handedly responsible for the lack of success happiness and quality of life that is at the center of every African American woman s fantasy quest It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men has been deliberately created by White America For example much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design There are other core issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation such as color barriers light skin versus dark skin good hair versus bad hair loyalty devotion and economic status Believe it or not there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn t sell drugs or was not thugged out a term for being rough or hoodlum like The reasoning behind it being that the thug and drug dealer lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence These issues among others relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society Sadly that confused mentality is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ghetto community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren Who have locked it away in the basement and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ghetto America does not exist Furthermore the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community Their plight is a well known reality but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella Be advised this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into Black America Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans including myself have come to perpetuate Moreover that backward thinking is the main cause of our inability to strive for a common goal An outcome that must be met and can only be met with Godly faith positive strategy cooperation love loyalty self and mutual respect To read More go to www blackrealitypublishing com To Unsubscribe send mail to majordomo FreeBSD org with unsubscribe freebsd ports in the body of the message ,1096,3028,hamnspam\spam

My name is Jeremy Lessaris I m looking for investment properties in the Midwest The issue I ve been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I m looking for You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell maybe they re really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood But for what ever reason the houses just don t sell I need those houses Most of the agents I ve dealt with were hesitant because there isn t much of a return for what time and effort you invest However the private investors I work with use unconventional private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week I am pre qualified with Greentree Funding for up to 900 000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non owner occupied loan at 90 LTV And of course you get your full commission I m not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm which means I can work with you just about any way you want Please don t be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested Sometimes I can even pay retail price The only guarantee I ll make is that I will not waste your time and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I m interested or not If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with Synteligent Properties please contact me 847 366 4300 or email me jeremy synteligent com Best Wishes Jeremy Lessaris 847 366 4300 www synteligent com jeremy synteligent com To Unsubscribe send mail to majordomo FreeBSD org with unsubscribe freebsd ports in the body of the message ,193,323,hamnspam\spam

Hello You may have seen this business before and ignored it I know I did many times However please take a few moments to read this letter I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in and it works With easy to use e mail tools and opt in e mail success in this business is now fast easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing And the earnings potential is truly staggering I ll make you a promise READ THIS E MAIL TO THE END follow what it says to the letter and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not who is President or whether you keep your current job or not Yes I know what you are thinking I never responded to one of these before either One day though something just said You throw away 25 00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife What the heck Believe me no matter where you believe those feelings come from I thank every day that I had that feeling I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not Read on It s true Every word of it It is legal I checked Simply because you are buying and selling something of value AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR Before you say Bull please read the following This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 25 out of pocket cost DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER This is what one had to say Thanks to this profitable opportunity I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required To my astonishment I received a total 610 470 00 in 21 weeks with money still coming in Pam Hedland Fort Lee New Jersey Another said This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my 25 on it I followed the simple instructions and walaa 3 weeks later the money started to come in First month I only made 240 00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 290 000 00 So far in the past 8 months by re entering the program I have made over 710 000 00 and I am playing it again The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything More testimonials later but first PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE If you would like to make at least 500 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably please read the following THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE GUARANTEED INSTRUCTIONS Order all 5 reports shown on the list below For each report send 5 CASH THE NAME NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER MAKE SURE YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them YOUR TOTAL COST 5 X 5 25 00 Within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000 s of people who will order them from you Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer IMPORTANT DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits Once you understand the way this works you will also see how it will not work if you change it Remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will NOT work People have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money But it does not work this way Believe us some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed Because if you do it will not work for you Remember honesty reaps the reward This IS a legitimate BUSINESS You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time 1 After you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement and REMOVE the name address of the person in REPORT 5 This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune 2 Move the name address in REPORT 4 down TO REPORT 5 3 Move the name address in REPORT 3 down TO REPORT 4 4 Move the name address in REPORT 2 down TO REPORT 3 5 Move the name address in REPORT 1 down TO REPORT 2 6 Insert YOUR name address in the REPORT 1 Position PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name address ACCURATELY This is critical to YOUR success Take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data To assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going METHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK E MAIL LEGALLY Let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e mails each Let s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 2 2 10 of 1 response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only 0 2 Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only 5 000 each Continuing with this example you send out only 5 000 e mails With a 0 2 response that is only 10 orders for report 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 Out of those 50 000 e mails only 0 2 responded with orders That s 100 people who responded and ordered Report 2 Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 500 000 e mails The 0 2 response to that is 1000 orders for Report 3 Those 1000 people send 5 000 e mails each for a total of 5 million e mails sent out The 0 2 response is 10 000 orders for Report 4 Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 000 50 million e mails The 0 2 response to that is 100 000 orders for Report 5 THAT S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH 500 000 00 half a million dollars Your total income in this example is 1 50 2 500 3 5 000 4 50 000 5 500 000 Grand Total 555 550 00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e mails each or more There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day Believe me many people will do just that and more METHOD 2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response We strongly suggest you start with Method 1 and add METHOD 2 as you go along For every 5 you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered That s it Always provide same day service on all orders This will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report AVAILABLE REPORTS The reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong It is simply about time Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER NAME ONLY Notes Always send 5 cash U S CURRENCY for each report Checks NOT accepted Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper On one of those sheets of paper write the NUMBER the NAME of the report you are ordering YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW REPORT 1 The Insider s Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net Order Report 1 from Rui Sousa Santos P O Box 132 Taylors Lakes VIC 3038 Australia

______________________________________________________ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report 1 within 2 weeks continue sending e mails until you do After you have received 10 orders 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT 2 If you do not continue advertising or sending e mails until you do Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report 2 YOU CAN RELAX because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a different report You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Do Not change it in any way It works exceedingly well as it is now Remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report 1 and moved others to 2 5 as instructed above One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e mails and your name will be on every one of them Remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach So my friend I have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent IT IS UP TO YOU NOW MORE TESTIMONIALS My name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago I am an accountant with a major U S Corporation and I make pretty good money When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving junk mail I made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved I knew it wouldn t work Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old I told you so on her when the thing didn t work Well the laugh was on me Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45 days she had received total 147 200 00 all cash I was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby Mitchell Wolf M D Chicago Illinois Not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan But conservative as I am I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders I made 319 210 00 in the first 12 weeks The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live There simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big Dan Sondstrom Alberta Canada I had received this program before I deleted

Hi I m a college dropout I work about two hours a day I m ambitious but extremely lazy and I make over 250 000 a year Are you curious yet In a minute I m going to tell you my secret it s the dirty little secret of the Internet You ve probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online but you thought they were the big corporate execs famous programmers or boy geniuses Well grasshopper think again It s people like you and me that are making the real money Yep people like YOU AND ME Ever since the dot com bubble burst in 1999 small time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work How By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created it s called BULK EMAIL If you ve ever recieved an email advertisement then you know what bulk email is I bet you can t click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads right You might not want their product but remember that thousands of other folks probably do Bulk email is a percentage game every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet I guarantee it Now let s go back to Math 101 and review some numbers If you sell on eBay you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction How many people see your ad Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days Using bulk email YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost Whether your send 100 000 emails or 100 million emails the price is the same ZERO Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of 20 00 on each sale If you send an email ad to 500 000 people and only one person in a thousand actually places an order then you just generated 500 orders and made 10 000 in a few hours of work It s that simple All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you re FILTHY RICH The best thing is that anyone can do it Doesn t matter if you re a nineteen year old college student using a dorm room computer or a fifty year old executive working from an office building in New York City Anyone and I repeat ANYONE can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs All it takes is a few days of study plenty of ambition and some basic familiarity with the Internet I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the Dot Com mania and I ve never looked back I started with no money no product to sell and only the most rudimentary computer skills I saw an opportunity and I seized it A few years later I bought my own home with CASH You don t need any money You don t need a product You don t need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you d jump right on it It would be a dream come true So what are you waiting for I m going to ask you four simple questions If you answer YES to all of them then I can almost promise that you will make at least 100 000 using bulk email this year Here goes Do you have basic experience with the web Do you have a computer and an Internet connection Do you have a few hours each day of free time Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom If you answer YES to these questions you could be making 5 000 20 000 per week working from your home Kiss your day job goodbye this sure beats the 9 5 daily grind All you need is ambition and commitment This is no get rich quick scheme You have to work to make big bucks but ANYONE and I

Hello You may have seen this business before and ignored it I know I did many times However please take a few moments to read this letter I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in and it works With easy to use e mail tools and opt in e mail success in this business is now fast easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing And the earnings potential is truly staggering I ll make you a promise READ THIS E MAIL TO THE END follow what it says to the letter and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not who is President or whether you keep your current job or not Yes I know what you are thinking I never responded to one of these before either One day though something just said You throw away 25 00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife What the heck Believe me no matter where you believe those feelings come from I thank every day that I had that feeling I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not Read on It s true Every word of it It is legal I checked Simply because you are buying and selling something of value AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR Before you say Bull please read the following This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 25 out of pocket cost DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER This is what one had to say Thanks to this profitable opportunity I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required To my astonishment I received a total 610 470 00 in 21 weeks with money still coming in Pam Hedland Fort Lee New Jersey Another said This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my 25 on it I followed the simple instructions and walaa 3 weeks later the money started to come in First month I only made 240 00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 290 000 00 So far in the past 8 months by re entering the program I have made over 710 000 00 and I am playing it again The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything More testimonials later but first PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE If you would like to make at least 500 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably please read the following THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE GUARANTEED INSTRUCTIONS Order all 5 reports shown on the list below For each report send 5 CASH THE NAME NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER MAKE SURE YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them YOUR TOTAL COST 5 X 5 25 00 Within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000 s of people who will order them from you Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer IMPORTANT DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits Once you understand the way this works you will also see how it will not work if you change it Remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will NOT work People have tried to put their friends relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money But it does not work this way Believe us some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed Because if you do it will not work for you Remember honesty reaps the reward This IS a legitimate BUSINESS You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time 1 After you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement and REMOVE the name address of the person in REPORT 5 This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune 2 Move the name address in REPORT 4 down TO REPORT 5 3 Move the name address in REPORT 3 down TO REPORT 4 4 Move the name address in REPORT 2 down TO REPORT 3 5 Move the name address in REPORT 1 down TO REPORT 2 6 Insert YOUR name address in the REPORT 1 Position PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name address ACCURATELY This is critical to YOUR success Take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data To assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going METHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK E MAIL LEGALLY Let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e mails each Let s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 2 2 10 of 1 response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only 0 2 Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only 5 000 each Continuing with this example you send out only 5 000 e mails With a 0 2 response that is only 10 orders for report 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 Out of those 50 000 e mails only 0 2 responded with orders That s 100 people who responded and ordered Report 2 Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 500 000 e mails The 0 2 response to that is 1000 orders for Report 3 Those 1000 people send 5 000 e mails each for a total of 5 million e mails sent out The 0 2 response is 10 000 orders for Report 4 Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 000 50 million e mails The 0 2 response to that is 100 000 orders for Report 5 THAT S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH 500 000 00 half a million dollars Your total income in this example is 1 50 2 500 3 5 000 4 50 000 5 500 000 Grand Total 555 550 00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e mails each or more There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day Believe me many people will do just that and more METHOD 2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response We strongly suggest you start with Method 1 and add METHOD 2 as you go along For every 5 you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered That s it Always provide same day service on all orders This will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report AVAILABLE REPORTS The reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong It is simply about time Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER NAME ONLY Notes Always send 5 cash U S CURRENCY for each report Checks NOT accepted Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper On one of those sheets of paper write the NUMBER the NAME of the report you are ordering YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address PLACE YOUR ORDER

______________________________________________________ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report 1 within 2 weeks continue sending e mails until you do After you have received 10 orders 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT 2 If you do not continue advertising or sending e mails until you do Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report 2 YOU CAN RELAX because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a different report You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Do Not change it in any way It works exceedingly well as it is now Remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report 1 and moved others to 2 5 as instructed above One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e mails and your name will be on every one of them Remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach So my friend I have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent IT IS UP TO YOU NOW MORE TESTIMONIALS My name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago I am an accountant with a major U S Corporation and I make pretty good money When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving junk mail I made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved I knew it wouldn t work Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old I told you so on her when the thing didn t work Well the laugh was on me Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45 days she had received total 147 200 00 all cash I was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby Mitchell Wolf M D Chicago Illinois Not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan But conservative as I am I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I

This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 25 out of pocket cost DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER This is what one had to say Thanks to this profitable opportunity I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required To my astonishment I received a total 610 470 00 in 21 weeks with money still coming in Pam Hedland Fort Lee New Jersey Another said This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it But one day when I received this

For each report send 5 CASH THE NAME NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER MAKE SURE YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer

ACCURATELY This is critical to YOUR success Take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data To assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going METHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK E MAIL LEGALLY Let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e mails each Let s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 2 2 10 of 1 response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only 0 2 Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only 5 000 each Continuing with this example you send out only 5 000 e mails With a 0 2 response that is only 10 orders for report 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 Out of those 50 000 e mails only 0 2 responded with orders That s 100 people who responded and ordered Report 2 Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 500 000 e mails The 0 2 response to that is 1000 orders for Report 3 Those 1000 people send 5 000 e mails each for a total of 5 million e mails sent out The 0 2 response is 10 000 orders for Report 4 Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e mails each for a total of 50 000 000 50 million e mails The 0 2 response to that is 100 000 orders for Report 5 THAT S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH 500 000 00 half a million dollars Your total income in this example is 1 50 2 500 3 5 000 4 50 000 5 500 000 Grand Total 555 550 00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e mails each or more There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day Believe me many people will do just that and more METHOD 2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response We strongly suggest you start with Method 1 and add METHOD 2 as you go along For every 5 you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered That s it Always provide same day service on all orders This will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report AVAILABLE REPORTS The reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong It is simply about time Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER NAME ONLY Notes Always send 5 cash U S CURRENCY for each report Checks NOT accepted Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper On one of those sheets of paper write the NUMBER the NAME of the report you are ordering YOUR E MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW REPORT 1 The Insider s Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net Order Report 1 from Robert Borowczyk ul J Olbrachta 118C m 28 01 373 Warsaw Poland

continue sending e mails until you do After you have received 10 orders 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT 2 If you do not continue advertising or sending e mails until you do Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report 2 YOU CAN RELAX because the system is already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a different report You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Do Not change it in any way It works exceedingly well as it is now Remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report 1 and moved others to 2 5 as instructed above One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e mails and your name will be on every one of them Remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach So my friend I have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent IT IS UP TO YOU NOW MORE TESTIMONIALS My name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago I am an accountant with a major U S Corporation and I make pretty good money When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving junk mail I made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved I knew it wouldn t work Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old I told you so on her when the thing didn t work Well the laugh was on me Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45 days she had received total 147 200 00 all cash I was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby Mitchell Wolf M D Chicago Illinois Not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan But conservative as I am I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders I made 319 210 00 in the first 12 weeks The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live There simply isn t a better investment with a faster return and so big Dan Sondstrom Alberta Canada I had received this program before I deleted

Hi I m a college dropout I work about two hours a day I m ambitious but extremely lazy and I make over 250 000 a year Are you curious yet In a minute I m going to tell you my secret it s the dirty little secret of the Internet You ve probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online but you thought they were the big corporate execs famous programmers or boy geniuses Well grasshopper think again It s people like you and me that are making the real money Yep people like YOU AND ME Ever since the dot com bubble burst in 1999 small time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work How By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created it s called BULK EMAIL If you ve ever recieved an email advertisement then you know what bulk email is I bet you can t click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads right You might not want their product but remember that thousands of other folks probably do Bulk email is a percentage game every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet I guarantee it Now let s go back to Math 101 and review some numbers If you sell on eBay you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction How many people see your ad Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days Using bulk email YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost Whether your send 100 000 emails or 100 million emails the price is the same ZERO Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of 20 00 on each sale If you send an email ad to 500 000 people and only one person in a thousand actually places an order then you just generated 500 orders and made 10 000 in a few hours of work It s that simple All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you re FILTHY RICH The best thing is that anyone can do it Doesn t matter if you re a nineteen year old college student using a dorm room computer or a fifty year old executive working from an office building in New York City Anyone and I repeat ANYONE can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs All it takes is a few days of study plenty of ambition and some basic familiarity with the Internet I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the Dot Com mania and I ve never looked back I started with no money no product to sell and only the most rudimentary computer skills I saw an opportunity and I seized it A few years later I bought my own home with CASH You don t need any money You don t need a product You don t need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you d jump right on it It would be a dream come true So what are you waiting for I m going to ask you four simple questions If you answer YES to all of them then I can almost promise that you will make at least 100 000 using bulk email this year Here goes Do you have basic experience with the web Do you have a computer and an Internet connection Do you have a few hours each day of free time Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom If you answer YES to these questions you could be making 5 000 20 000 per week working from your home Kiss your day job goodbye this sure beats the 9 5 daily grind All you need is ambition and commitment This is no get rich quick scheme You have to work to make big bucks but ANYONE and I

Mr Vincent Nnaji Standard Trust Bank Ltd Lagos Nigeria Dear Sir I am Mr Vincent Nnaji Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank Lagos Nigeria I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you On January 6 1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US 20M Twenty Million United States Dollars in my branch Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr James Herbert died from an automobile accident On further investigation I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank This sum of US 20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe keeping No one will ever come forward to claim it According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than 1m I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials This is simple I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes The money will be shared in the ratio of 70 for me and 25 for you and 5 will take care of all expenses There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction If you are interested please reply immediately via my private email address Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest Thanks and Regards MR VINCENT NNAJI ,269,540,hamnspam\spam
Dear Sir With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you would be of great assistance to my children and I I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed that you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to intimidate me or betray my trust after hearing this news I am a native of KONOBO in the KEREMA local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR MUNDI A KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul Koromah because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of Sierra Leone Few days before my husband was assassinated he instructed me and my children Ibrahim and Amina to move out of Sierra Leone immediately before the powerful Economic community of West African States ECOMOG forces intervened which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war My children and I managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband s friend We came into Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of 25MILLION TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY in two trunks boxes which I have deposited with a Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the currier company who will freight the money to your country Meanwhile I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in your country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the future of my children I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the Trust Company in any of their branches in Europe after which the fund will be deposited into your account for investment in your country You should also help us to source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have resolved to give you 20 of the total sum for your help But due to how I am being monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents I will advice you to have the deal concluded with my son IBRAHIM KOJO Please contact my son on this email ibrahimkojo caramail com immediately you receive this letter to enable us proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring same into your account Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private discussions Note There is no risk involved in this business Remain Blessed MRS ANNE KOJO ,244,440,hamnspam\spam

developmental than our botanical resource cooperative Even our own two signature smokables Ragga Dagga Stoney Mahoney are being discontinued That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence thereby our definition of excellence has evolved This Shangrila project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts First on an agricultural level fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken This is how the botanical achieves potent significance much like the regimen of ginseng Also harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year as like the hemp plant maximum potency is only achieved after flowering occurs But unlike the hemp plant and for that matter unlike most herbs the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie leave stem root is all viripotent which makes this gnarly stoke a botanical phenomenon As well most potentiating factors of Shangrila as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila will not achieve viripotency if grown in our hemisphere therefore Shangrila is indeed a multi national multi complicated agricultural undertaking However all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile Secondly the potentiating infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie We are most pleased to be able to say as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie that this
